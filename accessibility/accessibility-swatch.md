# Ocean Blue Accessibility Swatch

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) sections [1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) and [1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-enhanced) define the required contrast ratio for compliance. The WCAG Level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. WCAG Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text. Telerik UI for Blazor library conforms to WCAG Level AA with the Default Ocean Blue theme swatch (available as of **3.2.0** version).

You can test the accessibility swatch in our [live demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/overview) - it is initially selected in the `Change Theme` menu.

# Default Ocean Blue Accessibility Swatch

The Default Ocean Blue Accessibility Swatch is built on top of [Ocean Blue](#ocean-blue-accessibility-swatch). The difference is that it has contrast focus indicators and is compliant with WCAG requirements.

You can test the accessibility swatch in our [live demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/overview) - select the `Default Ocean Blue` option in the `Change Theme` dropdown menu.

> **Limitations:** ColorPalette fails WCAG success criteria 1.4.11. - "Non-text contrast for the focus indicator on its items".

Telerik UI for Blazor distributes the Default Ocean Blue theme and the Ocean Blue theme swatches via several resources. Read more in the [Swatch Distribution]({%slug themes-swatches%}) article.

In addition, both themes are also available in:

* [Themes CDN]({%slug themes-swatches%}#built-in-themes-and-swatches-list)
* [ThemeBuilder](https://themebuilderapp.telerik.com)&mdash;for testing and [color customization]({%slug themes-custom%})
* [kendo-themes repository](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes)
