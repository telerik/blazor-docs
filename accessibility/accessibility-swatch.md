# Ocean Blue Accessibility Swatch

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) sections [1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) and [1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-enhanced) define contrast ratios for accessibility compliance. The *Default Ocean Blue A11y* [theme swatch]({%slug themes-overview%}#basics) in Telerik UI for Blazor conforms to WCAG Level AA, which requires contrast ratios of at least:

* 4.5:1 for normal text
* 3:1 for large text


## Testing the Accessibility Swatch

To preview and test the Default Ocean Blue A11y swatch, visit the [Telerik UI for Blazor live demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/overview). Enable the swatch from the **Change Theme** dropdown above any of the examples.

The Default Ocean Blue A11y swatch is built on top of the Default Ocean Blue swatch. The main difference is that the Ocean Blue A11y swatch has high-contrast focus indicators to comply with WCAG requirements.


## Using the Accessibility Swatch

You can [obtain and use the Default Ocean Blue A11y swatch]({%slug themes-overview%}#swatch) starting from the following component and theme versions:

* [Telerik UI for Blazor version 4.0.1](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/blazor-ui/release-history/ui-for-blazor-4-0-1)
* [Themes version 6.0.3](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes/releases/tag/v6.0.3)

Check section [Theme Version Compatibility]({%slug themes-overview%}#compatibility-and-maintenance) for more information about how to align Telerik UI for Blazor versions with theme versions.

> An existing limitation is that the ColorPalette component fails WCAG success criterion 1.4.11. "Non-text contrast for the focus indicator on its items".
