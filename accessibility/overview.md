# Blazor Accessibility Overview

Websites and applications are accessible when they provide full control over their features by enabling users with disabilities to access their content through assistive technologies or keyboard navigation.

Accessibility consists of several aspects:

* [The WCAG, Section 508 and WAI-ARIA standards]({%slug accessibility-standards%})
* [Keyboard Navigation]({%slug accessibility-keyboard-navigation%})
* [Globalization]({%slug globalization-overview%})

### Voluntary Product Accessibility Template

A [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT®)](https://www.section508.gov/sell/vpat/) is a document that explains how information and communication technology (ICT) products such as software, hardware, electronic content, and support documentation meet (conform to) the Revised 508 Standards for IT accessibility.
