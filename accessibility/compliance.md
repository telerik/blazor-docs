# Accessibility Standards Compliance

This article lists the compliance with the various accessibility standards that the Telerik UI for Blazor components provide.

For details on the keyboard support, see the [Keyboard Navigation]({%slug accessibility-keyboard-navigation%}) article.

All components implement the required WAI-ARIA attributes without the need for any extra configuration.

Due to the complexity of some of the components in the suite, we sometimes run into scenarios not covered by the WAI-ARIA specification. In those cases, we tap into the web development accessibility know-how of the rest of the Progress organization, including feedback from accessibility-minded users, for expertise and feedback based on 10 years of creating web component libraries. This knowledge-sharing across internal teams and clients helps us ensure that UI for Blazor can reach a certain level of accessibility compliance even with its most advanced components.

This article will be updated with details on the Section 508 and WCAG 2.1 compatibility levels.

The Telerik UI for Blazor components are highly extensible and customizable. This means that, depending on the level of customization applied, you may be introducing rendering that is not accessible. Therefore, it is recommended that you test any modifications and templates you create to ensure the components still meet the desired level of accessibility standards. Additionally, be mindful of components working with custom input (images, text, HTML content, and so on) and make sure your content is accessible, too.
