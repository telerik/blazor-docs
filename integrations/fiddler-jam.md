# Fiddler Jam

[Fiddler Jam](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler-jam) is Telerik's new tool designed to facilitate the information exchange between the support and end-user. A simple capture log can provide a lot of useful information to the support team:

* Video recording and screenshots, along with sharable link
* Captured user actions such as mouse and keyboard interactions
* Captured console logs and errors
* Captured network traffic
* Captured Local and Session Storage logs

The tool's mission is to reduce the back-and-forth communication in support messages, and save time of our customers. In addition, this would help the support team understand and investigate the issue faster and thus the response time would be shorter.

## Install Fiddler Jam

Fiddler Jam provides powerful Chrome extension that could be installed from [Chrome Web Store page for Fiddler Jam](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fiddler-jam/fnkjlegmkbicdodlheligomlfbdblpfj). 

You could find detailed instruction on how to install the extension in [Fiddler Jam Extension Installation](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-jam/extension/installation) article.

## Capture a Log

Once you have [installed the Fiddler Jam browser extension](#installing-fiddler-jam), you can start capturing your use case, or an issue, and then send it to the support team. You can capture issues for both Blazor Server-side applications and Blazor WebAssembly applications.

The [Predefined Link](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-jam/fj-extension/predefined-link) functionality allows pre-configured setup for easy capture simply by clicking the link below. It will provide further instructions to follow.
