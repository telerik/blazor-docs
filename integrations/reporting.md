# Reporting

You can utilize the [Telerik Reporting](https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting) product to embed reporting functionality in your Blazor app. We provide the following components for easy integration (find detailed information in the respective articles that are part of the Telerik Reporting product documentation):

* The [Telerik Blazor Report Viewer Component](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/blazor-report-viewer) brings embedding a report preview functionality into you app. This includes  previewing the pages of the resulting report document on screen, printing the report, exporting it into various formats (e.g., PDF, Word, Excel), searching its content or using any other interactivity features that the Telerik Reporting product offers. See the report viewer component into action in the [Dashboard Report Demo](https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/dashboard) 

* The [Telerik Blazor Report Designer Component](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/how-to-blazor-web-report-designer) brings embedding of the report designer tool into your Blazor application. This empowers your trusted end-users to edit existing or create new report definitions from scratch.
