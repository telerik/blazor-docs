# Telerik Blazor MCP Server

The Telerik Blazor [MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) lets you interact with AI and reach new levels of developer productivity. The MCP server provides proprietary context to AI-powered IDEs, apps and tools. You can use the Telerik Blazor MCP server for Blazor AI code generation and ask about [Telerik UI for Blazor components](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui), features, or general usage. You can successfully prompt more complex questions and tasks, and generate tailored code that includes Telerik UI for Blazor components and API.

## Prerequisites

To use the Telerik Blazor MCP server, you need:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) 18 or a newer version.
* A [compatible MCP client (IDE, code editor or app)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) that supports *MCP tools*. Using the latest version of the MCP client is highly recommended.
* A [Telerik user account](https://www.telerik.com/account/).
* An active [DevCraft or Telerik UI for Blazor license](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/blazor-ui) or a [Telerik UI for Blazor trial](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui).
* A [Blazor application that includes Telerik UI for Blazor](slug:blazor-overview#getting-started).

## Installation

There are two ways to install the Telerik Blazor MCP server:

* Use a manual approach, which is described below.
* Use an automated process provided by the Telerik extensions for [Visual Studio](slug:getting-started-vs-integration-ai-configuration) and [VS Code](slug:getting-started-vs-code-integration-ai-configuration).

To install the Telerik MCP server manually, use the documentation of your AI-powered MCP client. You can enable the MCP server for specific workspaces or globally. The sections below provide installation tips and examples for some popular MCP clients like [Visual Studio](#visual-studio), [VS Code](#vs-code), and [Cursor](#cursor). The generic settings of the Telerik Blazor MCP server are:

* npm package name: `@progress/telerik-blazor-mcp`
* Type: `stdio` (standard input/output transport)
* Command: `npx`
* Arguments: `-y`
* Server name: `telerikBlazorAssistant` (depends on your preferences)
* Your [Telerik license key](#license-key) as an `env` parameter

> * Do not use hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) in the MCP server name in the MCP `.json` file, due to potential compatibility issues with some MCP clients such as Visual Studio or Windsurf.
> * Some MCP clients expect the MCP servers to be listed under a `servers` JSON key, while others expect `mcpServers`.
> * Some MCP clients expect an `mcp.json` file, while others like Visual Studio 2022 expect an `.mcp.json` file.

### License Key

To use the Telerik MCP Server, your configuration must provide your [Telerik licence key](slug:installation-license-key) as an `env` parameter in the MCP `.json` file. There are two options:

* Use a `TELERIK_LICENSE_PATH` argument and point to your Telerik license file location. This approach is recommended, unless you are sharing your VS Code settings across different computers with different operating systems or user names.
* Use a `TELERIK_LICENSE` argument and paste your Telerik license key. Make sure to [update the license key](slug:installation-license-key#license-key-updates) when necessary.

### Visual Studio

For detailed instructions, refer to [Use MCP servers in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/mcp-servers). You can also install the Telerik Blazor MCP server through the [Telerik UI for Blazor Visual Studio extension](slug:getting-started-vs-integration-ai-configuration).

> Early Visual Studio 17.14 versions require the Copilot Chat window to be open and active when you open a solution. Otherwise the Telerik MCP server is not used.

To enable the Telerik MCP Server in a specific Blazor app, add a `.mcp.json` file to the solution folder.

>caption .mcp.json

````JSON.skip-repl
{
  "servers": {
    "telerikBlazorAssistant": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@progress/telerik-blazor-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "TELERIK_LICENSE_PATH": "C:\\Users\\___\\AppData\\Roaming\\Telerik\\telerik-license.txt"
      }
    }
  }
}
````

To enable global automatic discovery of the Telerik MCP Server in Visual Studio, add the above `.mcp.json` file to your user directory (`%USERPROFILE%`), for example, `C:\Users\____\.mcp.json`.

> Once the Telerik MCP server is added, make sure that the `telerikBlazorAssistant` tool is [enabled (checked) in the Copilot Chat window's tool selection dropdown](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/mcp-servers?view=vs-2022#configuration-example-with-github-mcp-server). The Telerik MCP server may get disabled and you may see "ðŸ”§10/11" in the selected tools dropdown when starting a new chat, changing threads, or relaunching Visual Studio. This is a known issue for MCPs that is being investigated.

### VS Code

For detailed instructions, refer to [Use MCP servers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers). You can also install the Telerik Blazor MCP server through the [Telerik UI for Blazor VS Code extension](slug:getting-started-vs-code-integration-ai-configuration).

> This section applies to VS Code 1.102.1 and newer versions.

Make sure that [`chat.mcp.enabled`](vscode://settings/chat.mcp.enabled) is enabled in the VS Code settings.

To enable the Telerik MCP Server in a specific [workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-to-your-workspace), Blazor app, or [globally](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-to-your-user-configuration), add a `.vscode` folder with an `mcp.json` file at the root of the workspace, app, or your user folder, respectively.

>caption .vscode/mcp.json

````JSON.skip-repl
{
  "servers": {
    "telerikBlazorAssistant": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@progress/telerik-blazor-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "TELERIK_LICENSE_PATH": "C:\\Users\\___\\AppData\\Roaming\\Telerik\\telerik-license.txt"
      }
    }
  }
}
````

To use the Telerik MCP server in all workspaces and apps, make sure that [`chat.mcp.discovery.enabled`](vscode://settings/chat.mcp.discovery.enabled) is enabled in [`settings.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_settings-json-file).

>caption VS Code settings.json

````JSON.skip-repl
{
  // ...
  "chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true,
}
````

### Cursor

For detailed instructions, refer to [Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/mcp).

To [enable the Telerik MCP Server in a specific workspace, Blazor app, or globally](https://docs.cursor.com/context/mcp#using-mcp-json), add a `.cursor` folder with an `mcp.json` file at the root of the workspace, app, or your user folder, respectively.

>caption .cursor/mcp.json

````JSON.skip-repl
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "telerikBlazorAssistant": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@progress/telerik-blazor-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "TELERIK_LICENSE_PATH": "C:\\Users\\___\\AppData\\Roaming\\Telerik\\telerik-license.txt"
      }
    }
  }
}
````

## Usage

To use the Telerik MCP Server:

1. Start your prompt with one of the following:
    * `telerik`
    * `/telerik`
    * `@telerik`
    * `telerikblazor`
    * `/telerikblazor`
    * `@telerikblazor`
1. Confirm that the Telerik MCP server is used, because this doesn't happen deterministically. Look for a statement in the output, which is similar to:
    * `Running telerikBlazorAssistant` (in VS Code)
    * `Calling MCP tool telerikBlazorAssistant` (in Cursor)

    If the Telerik MCP server is not used even though it's installed and enabled, then try rephrasing your prompt and use another trigger syntax from the list in step 1.
1. Grant the Telerik tool permission to run for this session, workspace, or always.
1. If you want to prompt for information or code that are not related to your previous prompts, it is a good practice to start a new session in a new chat window, so that the context is not polluted by irrelevant old information.

To increase the probability of the Telerik MVC Server being used, or to call it without the need to mention "telerik" explicitly, add custom instructions to your AI-powered tool. Here are examples for [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot#about-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot-chat) and [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules).

### Sample Prompts

The following list describes how your prompts may look like:

* &quot;Telerik Generate a Blazor Grid with sorting and paging enabled. Bind the Grid to a Person model and provide dummy data.&quot;
* &quot;Telerik Generate a ComboBox for Blazor that shows a list of products. Create a Product class and generate sample data.&quot;
* &quot;Telerik Show me sample code for a Blazor Grid with virtual scrolling for the rows and columns.&quot;

## Number of Requests

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/ai-coding-assistant.md#number-of-requests)

## Connect to Local AI Model

You can use the Telerik Blazor MCP server with local large language models (LLM). For example, run your local model through [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and use a third-party package such as [MCP-LLM Bridge](https://github.com/patruff/ollama-mcp-bridge) to connect the model to the Telerik MCP server. This will allow you to use the Telerik AI Coding Assistant without a cloud-based AI model.
