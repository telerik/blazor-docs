# Agentic UI Generator Prompt Library

This article provides example prompts that demonstrate the capabilities of the Telerik UI for Blazor Agentic UI Generator. Use these as inspiration for building modern web applications with speed and precision.

## How to Use the Prompts

All prompts in this library target the Agentic UI Generator. The `#telerik_ui_generator` handle explicitly calls the generator, but you can also use natural language descriptions and let your AI assistant automatically recognize when to use the Agentic UI Generator.

1. Browse the prompt library to find a prompt that suits your needs.
2. Copy the prompt text (including the `#telerik_ui_generator` handle if present).
3. (optional) Customize the prompt as needed for your specific use case. Make sure the changes comply with the [intended use](slug:agentic-ui-generator-overview#intended-use) and the [recommendations](slug:agentic-ui-generator-overview#recommendations) for the Agentic UI Generator.
4. Run the prompt against your AI-powered IDE.

>warning Always double-check the code and solutions proposed by any AI-powered tool before applying them to your project.

## Sample Prompts

Here are some example prompts that demonstrate the generator's capabilities:

### Dashboard Creation

````TEXT.skip-repl
Create a new page using the existing top navigation and footer. In the middle, add 3 rows with 3 responsive columns each. The top row shows charts, the second data grids, and the bottom contains column summaries
````

### Interactive Data Page

````TEXT.skip-repl
Insert a new section with a Data Grid on the left to filter, sort, and edit product data. On the right, add a Chart and Date Range Picker to visualize product sales over time. Both components should be data-bound to the same source and reactively update based on the selected date range

### Theme Customization

Add a dark mode theme to the application with rounded corners and larger spacing between components
````

### Responsive Page

````TEXT.skip-repl
