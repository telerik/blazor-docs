# Telerik Blazor AI Coding Assistant Overview

The Telerik Blazor AI Coding Assistant improves your developer experience and increases your productivity when implementing Blazor apps that include Telerik UI for Blazor. The coding assistant is an AI code generator that provides proprietary context to AI models in order to produce higher quality code samples with the [Telerik UI for Blazor components](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui) and API.

The Telerik AI Coding Assistant is integrated in:

* The [Telerik Blazor GitHub Copilot Extension](slug:ai-copilot-extension)
* The [Telerik Blazor MCP Server](slug:ai-mcp-server)

The major differences between these tools are:

* The MCP server is more powerful and can handle more complex prompts that require several requests to the AI model. An MCP-enabled client like GitHub Copilot in **Agent** mode can make changes to your app and rebuild it to verify the AI suggestions.
* The responses of the GitHub Copilot extension may contain shorter or partial code snippets and more explanations how to accomplish the task. When using the MCP server, the AI response is mostly code.

## Getting Started

To use the Telerik Blazor AI Coding Assistant, you need:

* A [Telerik user account](https://www.telerik.com/account/).
* An active [DevCraft or Telerik UI for Blazor license](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/blazor-ui) or a [Telerik UI for Blazor trial](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui).
* A [Blazor application that includes Telerik UI for Blazor](slug:blazor-overview#getting-started).

> A Telerik [Subscription license](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/faq/licensing-purchasing) is recommended in order to use the Telerik Blazor AI Coding Assistant:
> 
> * Subscription license holders can make an unlimited number of requests.
> * Perpetual license holders and trial users have a limited number of requests per year.

## Next Steps

* Install the [Telerik Blazor GitHub Copilot Extension](slug:ai-copilot-extension).
* Add the [Telerik Blazor MCP Server](slug:ai-mcp-server) to an MCP-enabled client.
