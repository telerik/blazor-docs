# Telerik MCP Server Changelog

Learn about the latest changes, improvements and bug fixes in the Telerik UI for Blazor AI Coding Assistant. The updates are structured in a chronological order with the newest ones appearing first.

## January, 2026 Changelog

### Highlights

- **AI Tools Unified Under Single MCP Server**&mdash;The AI Coding Assistant and Agentic UI Generator are now delivered through a single [Telerik MCP server](slug:ai-installation).

- **AI Coding Assistant Now Includes Orchestrator**&mdash;Introduced an intelligent orchestrator that coordinates two specialized tools: the Component Tool for component implementation and configuration, and the Icon Tool for icon search and recommendations from the Progress Design System.
- **Automatic License Recognition**&mdash;The MCP server automatically detects your Telerik license when configured globally, simplifying the setup process.
