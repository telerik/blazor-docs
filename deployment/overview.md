@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/general-info.md#ci-cd-support)

## Prerequisites

Refer to the Microsoft Blazor deployment documentation and make sure you can deploy a vanilla Blazor application without Telerik components in order to have the entire pipeline working as a baseline.

* [Host and deploy ASP.NET Core Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/blazor/)
* [Host and deploy Blazor Server apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/server)
* [Host and deploy Blazor WebAssembly apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly)


## Telerik Components

The Telerik UI for Blazor components consist of:

* assemblies
* static CSS and JavaScript assets

These resources are distributed in our [NuGet packages]({%slug getting-started/what-you-need%}#nuget-packages). The .NET SDK is responsible for copying the Telerik `.dll`, `.css`, and `.js` files from the local NuGet cache to the target folder during the build or publish.

>important The build machine must be able to [restore the Telerik NuGet packages from a remote or local NuGet feed]({%slug getting-started/what-you-need%}#getting-the-telerik-nuget-packages). See the [CI, CD, Build Server]({%slug deployment-ci-cd-build-pc%}) article for more details on automation setup.

## Testing and Building Licenses

The licensing model of Telerik UI for Blazor is based on developer seats. Separate licenses for test and build environments are not available. For details and next steps, refer to the **Testing and Building License** section in the [Telerik UI for Blazor license agreement](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/license-agreement/blazor-ui).
