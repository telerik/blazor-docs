* **Edit**&mdash;Opens the source in the integrated Telerik REPL for Blazor Editor.

* **Preview**&mdash;Runs the snippet in the integrated Telerik REPL for Blazor Result View.

## Demos Integration

[The Telerik UI for Blazor demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui) support integration with Telerik REPL for Blazor.

## Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code Integration

Telerik Extensions for [Visual Studio]({%slug getting-started-vs-integration-overview%}) and [Visual Studio Code]({%slug getting-started-vs-code-integration-overview%}) provide option to easily share your code to the Telerik REPL for Blazor with a few clicks. You can share the whole file or just a selection.

The command can be used if more than 10 symbols are selected. Otherwise Visual Studio will disable the command, and Visual Studio Code will show an error message ("Expected at least 10 characters"). In case of multiple selection, every new piece will be concatenated on a new line.

If no selection is made, the whole file will be shared to Telerik REPL for Blazor. Only single files can be shared per command and not the whole application. Once the share to REPL process is triggered, status notifications will appear in the bottom-right corner for a few seconds. After that, the default browser will open with the uploaded snippet.
