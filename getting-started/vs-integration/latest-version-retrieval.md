# Download New Versions

The Progress&reg; Telerik&reg; UI for Blazor Visual Studio (VS) extensions enable you to keep your projects updated.


<!--
The Latest Version Retrieval tool automatically checks for the latest Telerik UI for Blazor distribution which is available for you on the Telerik website. Once a day, upon loading a project with Telerik UI for Blazor components, the extensions query the Telerik website for a new version of Telerik UI for Blazor. When a new version is detected, a notification is displayed that lets you download it.

>tip The **Latest Version Acquirer** tool downloads a `.zip` file which contains the latest Telerik UI for Blazor packages. It is saved in the `%APPDATA%\Telerik\Updates` folder by default. If you find the list of the offered packages too long and you do not need the older versions, close VS and use the Windows Explorer to delete these distributions.
