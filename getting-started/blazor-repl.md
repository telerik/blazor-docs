### Toolbar

The Toolbar of Blazor REPL contains the commands that can be performed with the code in the [Editor](#editor):

* `Run` - executes the code from the editor and renders it in the [Output](#output)
* `Save` - allows you to save the snippet. Opens a confirmation popup, if confirmed a pulic link with the snippet will be generated
* `Download` - downloads the project dll
* `Theme chooser` - allows you to choose one of the three built-in themes that will be applied on the project. Custom theme could also be applied through the [Static Asset Manager](#static-asset-manager)

### Static Asset Manager

The Static Asset Manager allows you to add a cdn with your desired CSS or JavaScript files. Place the file URL in the input and click the `+` button. You don't need to reference the files, Blazor REPL will do that for you.

### Editor

The Editor allows you to type, paste, edit your code. It always contains `Main.razor` file and you can also add other files to the project via the `+` button. Through the settings button you can open the `Startup.cs` file of the project and modify it if desired.


### Output

In the Output window, you can see the result of the run project. You can open it in full screen via the ... button???

### Error List

Blazor REPL provides an Error List that provides details on the errows thrown at runtime (if any). It can be expanded/collapsed via arrow buttons
