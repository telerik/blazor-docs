# Welcome to UI for Blazor

Thank you for choosing Telerik® UI for Blazor!

The [Blazor framework](https://blazor.net/) by Microsoft allows you to create web applications with .NET and C# to create front-end. The Telerik® UI for Blazor components facilitate the front-end development by providing you with ready made UI components.

The UI for Blazor suite shares HTML rendering and web assets (like stylesheets) with the Kendo UI suites, so you can reuse existing knowledge and classes. The components in **UI for Blazor are native components** and not wrappers over jQuery widgets, however.

Telerik UI for Blazor supports both Client-side Blazor and Serve-side Blazor apps.
