# Welcome to UI for Blazor

Thank you for choosing <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui" target="_blank">Telerik® UI for Blazor</a>!

The <a href="https://blazor.net/" target="_blank">Blazor framework by Microsoft</a> allows you to create rich web user interfaces with .NET and C#. The Telerik® UI for Blazor components facilitate the front-end development by providing ready-made UI components.

The UI for Blazor suite has the same HTML rendering and Theme stylesheets as the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/all-products" target="_blank">Kendo UI suites</a>, so previous experience with them can be helpful. The components in UI for Blazor are *native Blazor components* and not wrappers over jQuery widgets.

Visit the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui" target="_blank">Telerik UI for Blazor product overview page</a> to learn the benefits of using our components.

## Getting Started

If you are new to Telerik UI for Blazor, visit the Getting Started tutorials that demonstrate how to add the Telerik components to your application:
