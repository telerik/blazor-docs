# Welcome to UI for Blazor

Thank you for choosing Telerik® UI for Blazor!

The [Blazor framework](https://blazor.net/) by Microsoft allows you to create web applications with .NET and C# to create front-end. The Telerik® UI for Blazor components facilitate the front-end development by providing you with ready made UI components.

>tip Telerik UI for Blazor supports both Client-side (WebAssembly) Blazor and Server-side Blazor apps.

The UI for Blazor suite has the same HTML rendering and Theme stylesheets like other Kendo UI suites, so previous experience with them can be helpful. The components in **UI for Blazor are native components** and not wrappers over jQuery widgets, however.

To read more about the benefits of using Telerik UI for Blazor, please visit the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui" target="_blank">product overview page</a>.
