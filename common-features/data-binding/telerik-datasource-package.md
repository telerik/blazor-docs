# Telerik DataSource Package

The Telerik DataSource NuGet package is a set of classes and extension methods that help with remote (server-side) sorting, paging, grouping and filtering data collections.

## Basics

The `Telerik.DataSource` package is distributed through the [Telerik NuGet package source]({%slug installation/nuget%}) and is available to both trial and commercial licenses. It is also available as a resource in the [offline installer]({%slug installation/msi%}) and [resources archive]({%slug installation/zip%}) of Telerik UI for Blazor and some other Telerik suites, such as UI for ASP.NET Core.

The `Telerik.DataSource` package targets `netstandard2.1`.

This package lets you get or generate a request to the data source that describes various settings such as filters, paging, sorting, grouping, and, through extension methods, provides you with a resulting data set according to those settings.

If you are using an EntityFramework backend that provides an `IQueryable` collection, using the Telerik DataSource extension methods on it will execute the queries (operations) at the database level, which can improve performance compared to fetching all the data to the C# code and only then implementing operations on it.

### Key Classes and Extensions Methods

The following classes and extension methods are the key components to the package:

* The `ToDataSourceResult(DataSourceRequest request)` [extension method](/blazor-ui/api/Telerik.DataSource.Extensions.QueryableExtensions) - this method is in the `Telerik.DataSource.Extensions` namespace, and is available for `IQueryable`, `IEnumerable` and `DataTable`. It receives a `DataSourceRequest` argument and returns a `DataSourceResult` object. It also has an async version (with the standard `Async` suffix to the method name). This is the method that facilitates the data operations itself so you don't have to implement them. These methods are in the `Telerik.DataSource.Extensions` namespace.

    * The `ToDataSourceResult` method generates a LINQ expressions based on the `DataSourceRequest` and passes them to the `IQueryable.Provider`. It is up to the provider (collection) to resolve it and execute it against the database (for example, an `IQueryable` coming from an EntityFrameworkCore context will create and run an SQL query for you).

* [`DataSourceRequest`](/blazor-ui/api/Telerik.DataSource.DataSourceRequest) - the class that describes the request for data - what page index, page size, filters and sorts, groups and aggregates are required by the client. You can receive it from Telerik components (such as the [Blazor grid in its manual data operations mode]({%slug components/grid/manual-operations%})), or over the wire and deserialize it (such as for requests coming from widgets like the [UI for ASP.NET Core Grid with remote data](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-core/grid/remote-data-binding)). You can even create a `new` instance of the object and populate its fields according to some other business logic (like an OData query string or some other case). This object is in the `Telerik.DataSource` namespace.

    * When you receive such an object from a Telerik component, you can iterate over the information it provides and implement you own data source operations, you are not obliged to use the `ToDataSourceResult` method (but it helps shape the data accordingly, so you may want to examine its `DataSourceResult` from a simple run to see what it contains).

* [`DataSourceResult`](/blazor-ui/api/Telerik.DataSource.DataSourceResult) - the resulting data set from the operations on the data source. It will contain the current page of data, for its appropriate index, according to the designated filters, sorts, groups; and it will also contain the total number of items in the data source. It will also contain aggregate data. This is what you would normally serialize over the wire to send back to the client (or pass by reference in case of C#-only services). This object is in the `Telerik.DataSource` namespace.



## Examples

The general usage is as simple as defining (or receiving) a `DataSourceRequest` object, passing it to the `ToDataSourceResult` extension method, and consuming the `DataSourceResult` object that comes out of it.

>tip You can find more complex use cases and examples, such as serializing grouped data and using custom serializers (such as `Newtonsoft.Json`) in the following sample projects (note: they are written in Blazor, but the backend services they simulate are standard .NET Core code): <a href="https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/datasourcerequest-on-server" target="_blank">Use Telerik DataSourceRequest and DataSourceResult on the server</a>.

## Differences with Kendo DataSource

If you have used other Telerik products before, such as the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core or Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC, you may be familiar with or you may already be using the `DataSourceResult`, `ToDataSourceResult` and `DataSourceResult` features. They are available as part of those respective packages (assemblies), and the `Telerik.DataSource` package is those features extracted into a smaller, more lightweight package that is platform agnostic. This means that it has a few differences from the Kendo methods:

* The `Telerik.DataSource` packages uses the `System.Text.Json` serializer, and if you use custom serializers such as `Newtonsoft.Json`, you may need to tweak their settings so they ignore casing, and so they can serialize the Telerik objects. You can read more about this and find example in the <a href="https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/datasourcerequest-on-server/CustomSerializer" target="_blank">Use DataSourceRequest and DataSourceResult and WebAPI in a WebAssembly Blazor app with custom serialization</a> sample project.

* The `Telerik.DataSource` package does not have model binding features, because it is not coupled to the MVC framework.

    * Other MVC-specific features that may exist in the Kendo version may not be present in the `Telerik.DataSource` package.
