# Testing With Test Studio

[Telerik Test Studio](https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio/) provides [Translators](https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio/general-information/test-recording/translators) for most of the components in the Telerik UI for Blazor suite. You can use them to record UI tests out of the box for your Blazor applications without the need to code.
