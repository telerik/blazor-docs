# Telerik Private NuGet Feed

This article explains how to add the private Telerik NuGet feed to your system. You can use it to obtain the Telerik UI for Blazor components.

>tip Once you have the feed working, you can add the Telerik components to your project - both [client-side Blazor](../getting-started/client-blazor) and [server-side Blazor](../getting-started/server-blazor). You can also find more details in the [What You Need](../getting-started/what-you-need) article.

## Add the Telerik Private NuGet Feed to Your System

To add the Telerik private NuGet feed, follow the steps below:

1. Download the [latest NuGet executable](https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe).
1. Open a Command Prompt and change the path to where the `nuget.exe` is downloaded.
1. Execute the command from the example below.

### Store Encrypted Credentials

The command from the example below stores a token in the `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.config` file. Your original credentials cannot be obtained from this token.

>note If you are unable to connect to the feed by using encrypted credentials, try the alternative approach of storing credentials in clear text explained below. The ASP.NET Core tooling this step is based on does not fully support encrypted credentials.

```
NuGet Sources Add -Name "telerik.com" -Source "https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget" ^
      -UserName "your login email" -Password "your password"
```

### Store Credentials in Clear Text for the Telerik NuGet feed

The command from the example below stores the password in clear text in the `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.config` file. If you are unable to connect to the feed using encrypted credentials, use this alternative approach.

```
NuGet Sources Add -Name "telerik.com" -Source "https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget" ^
      -UserName "your login email" -Password "your password" ^
      -StorePasswordInClearText
```

If you have already stored a token instead of storing the credentials as clear text, update the definition in the `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.config` file by using the command below.

```
NuGet Sources Update -Name "telerik.com" -Source "https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget" ^
      -UserName "your login email" -Password "your password" ^
      -StorePasswordInClearText
```
