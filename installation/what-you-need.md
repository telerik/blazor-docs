# What You Need to Use the Telerik Blazor Components

This article explains the packages you need to use the Telerik UI for Blazor components, and how to get them.

## Telerik Specific Packages

The Telerik UI for Blazor component suite requires the following two Telerik-specific NuGet packages:

* `Telerik.UI.for.Blazor`
* `Telerik.DataSource`

Adding the `Telerik.UI.for.Blazor` package to your project will automatically add the `Telerik.DataSource` package as a dependency.

There are four ways to get these packages:

* The **[Telerik private NuGet feed]({%slug installation/nuget%})** that requires an Internet connection and credentials. It also provides information about updates and new versions.

* The **[Automated MSI installer]({%slug installation/msi%})**. You can download it from your account once and use without an Internet connection. It does not provide information about new versions. Depending on your setup, it may require elevated privileges to run the install wizard.

* The **[ZIP archive]({%slug installation/zip%})** package. You can download it from your account once and it does not require Internet connection after that. It does not provide information about new versions, and does not require installation. It also provides an offline version of our [demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui).

* The standalone **.nupkg files**. They are the bare minimum that is required. To use them, follow the instructions for using the [ZIP archive]({%slug installation/zip%}), but download the `.nupkg` files instead.

Before you continue, make sure you can use Blazor. Read below for more details. Once you have Blazor running, follow the articles above to see how to add the Telerik components to your project.
