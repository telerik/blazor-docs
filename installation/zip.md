# ZIP Archive

This article explains what the `zip` archive for Telerik UI for Blazor components includes, and how to get it.

The most common way to install the Telerik UI for Blazor components is to use the [Telerik NuGet feed]({%slug installation/nuget%}). However, you can also use a [wizard installer]({%slug installation/msi%}), or a ZIP archive.

The `ZIP` archive provides the following:

* The [necessary `.nupkg` files]({%slug getting-started/what-you-need%}) so you can setup a [local feed in Visual Studio](#set-up-a-local-nuget-feed-in-visual-studio). You can find them in the `packages` folder in the archive.
* An offline version of our [demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui) that you can run and inspect in your IDE. You can find them in the `demos` folder in the archive.
* The [document processing]({%slug dpl-in-blazor%}) `.nupkg` files (in the `dpl` folder).
* The [built-in themes]({%slug themes-overview%}) and some of their most commonly used [swatches]({%slug themes-overview%}#basics). You can find them in the `styles` folder in the archive.
