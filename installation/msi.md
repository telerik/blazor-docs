# MSI Wizard Installer

This article explains what the automated `msi` installer does for Telerik UI for Blazor components, and how to get it.

While the most common way to install the Telerik UI for Blazor components is to use the [Telerik private NuGet feed]({%slug installation/nuget%}), you can also use a wizard installer, or a [zip archive]({%slug installation/zip%}).

The `MSI` installer provides the following:

* The [necessary `.nupkg` files]({%slug getting-started/what-you-need%}) so you can setup a [local feed in Visual Studio](#set-up-a-local-nuget-feed-in-visual-studio). You can find them in the `packages` folder under the installation folder.
* An offline version of our [demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui) that you can run and inspect in your IDE. You can find them in the `demos` folder in the installation.
* A shortcut to our [online demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui).
* Our [Visual Studio Extensions]({%slug getting-started-vs-integration-overview%})
