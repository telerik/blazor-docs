#delete-confirmation
The built-in Delete Confirmation Dialog requires minimum effort and code. Thus, the dialog itself does not provide customization options.

To achieve custom appearance and behavior of the Delete Confirmation Dialog, use one of the following options:

* **Localization** - this approach is useful if you want to change just the text of the built-in Delete Confirmation Dialog elements. It does not allow adding item details to the dialog text.

* **Predefined Dialog Component** - this option is useful if you want to change the dialog text and include some details for the item the user tries to delete (for example, record name).

* **Dialog Component** - this solution allows you to fully customize the rendering and appearance of the dialog. You may set the desired `ThemeColor` and add any content there, be that custom text, HTML elements or other components.
