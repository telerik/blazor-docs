#fileselect-upload-comparison

The FileSelect and Upload components are similar and even inter-changeable. The major difference is how they communicate with the server and this can determine which component to use.

* The [**FileSelect**]({%slug fileselect-overview%}) is more suitable for **WebAssembly** apps if you want to receive and manipulate the file in the browser's .NET runtime. Uploading the file to a remote server is optional and depends on manual coding in the [`OnSelect` handler]({%slug fileselect-events%}#onselect). The benefit is that FileSelect allows full control over the upload process. In Blazor **Server** apps, the FileSelect uses the **SignalR WebSocket** and large file support (> 32KB) requires [`MaximumReceiveMessageSize` configuration]({%slug fileselect-overview%}#large-file-support).
* The [**Upload**]({%slug upload-overview%}) uses the **HTTP protocol**. Prefer this component in Blazor **Server** and **WebAssembly** apps to directly send files to a remote endpoint, as HTTP is the usual way to do this. Large file support requires [different configurations]({%slug upload-overview%}#large-file-uploads), depending on the receiving web server.
