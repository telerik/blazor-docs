#dropdownbutton-splitbutton-comparison
The DropDownButton and SplitButton components are similar. They both consist of a primary button and a dropdown element that holds additional action items. The major difference is the purpose of the primary button.

* [DropDownButton]({%slug dropdownbutton-overview%})&mdash;The main purpose of the primary button is to open the popup with additional actions. The primary button exposes a separate [`OnClick` event]({%slug dropdownbutton-events%}), which can invoke a dedicated action. Clicking on the DropDownButton always opens the dropdown.

* [SplitButton]({%slug splitbutton-overview%})&mdash;The main element contains a primary button and a separate button for opening the dropdown. The purpose of the primary button is to [invoke a standalone action]({%slug splitbutton-events%}#onclick). Clicking on it does not open the dropdown. To open the popup with the additional actions, the user has to click the dedicated button with `caret-alt-down` icon. It is possible to [switch the primary and dropdown actions programmatically]({%slug splitbutton-kb-change-primary-action-onclick%}).
