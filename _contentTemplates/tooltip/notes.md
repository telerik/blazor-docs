If left empty, stretches to accommodate the content. See the [Dimensions]({%slug common-features/dimensions%}) article. Do not use `%` values because percentage values heavily depend on the styles of the parent element and the tooltip does not have a well defined parent element that can be properly relative to all possible targets.
