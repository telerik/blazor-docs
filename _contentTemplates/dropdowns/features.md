#data-binding
requires a data source so that it can populate the dropdown with data. To provide a data source, use the `Data` property.
#end

#filtering
has a built-in filter that narrows down the shown suggestions as the end-user types. To configure this feature, use the `Filterable` parameter. Additionally, you can choose between different filter operators and configure after how many symbols the list with suggestions will appear.
#end

#grouping
enables you to group the listed suggestions into categories so you can help the end-user to browse faster through longer lists.
#end

#templates
You can use the functionality of the built-in templates and customize the default rendering of the component.
#end

#validation
You can ensure that the component value is acceptable by using the built-in validation. [Read more about input validation...]({%slug common-features/input-validation%}).
#end

#virtualization
By virtualizing the elements in the dropdown, you can use huge data sources without performance issues. The UI virtualization works with both local and remote data.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Class` | `string` | The CSS class that will be rendered on the main wrapping element of the component. Use it to [override the theme or apply custom styles]({%slug themes-override%}). |
| `Width` | `string` | The width of the component. It will target both the dropdown and the main element if the dropdown has no specific width set. @[template](/_contentTemplates/inputs/inputs-width-template.md#inputs-width-information) |
#end

#popup-settings
@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AnimationDuration` | `int` <br /> (`300`) | Sets the dropdown animation duration in milliseconds. |
| `Class` | `string` | Additional CSS class to customize the appearance of the popup. |
| `Height` | `string` | The height of the popup. The default value is `"200px"`. If set to `"auto"`, the component will automatically adjust the popup height based on the number of items and available space. Note that if you set the `MaxHeight` parameter, the built-in screen boundary detection will be disabled. This means the component will no longer adjust the dropdown height to fit within the viewport. |
| `MinHeight`| `string` | The minimum height of the popup. |
| `MinWidth` | `string` | The minimum width of the popup. |
| `MaxHeight` | `string` | The maximum height of the popup. |
| `MaxWidth` | `string` | The maximum width of the popup. |
| `Width` | `string` | The width of the popup. If you don't specify a value, the dropdown width will match the anchor element width which can help with responsive layouts and 100% widths. |

The parameters that modify the popup dimensions (`Height`, `Width`, `MaxWidth`, etc.) expect [valid CSS values]({%slug common-features/dimensions%}). 

The `MinHeight` and `MaxHeight` have no effect if the `Height` is always within their range. The min and max values are useful only when the dropdown height is set to a relative unit or changes at runtime.

>If the **Virtualization** feature is enabled, it's important to note that the **auto** popup width functionality doesn't work as expected. In this scenario, the dropdown popup width does not dynamically adjust based on the data items. When dealing with virtualization and long items, specifying a fixed popup `Width` becomes imperative. For example, set a fixed width like `"300px"`. To determine this fixed width value, you can identify the longest item in the dropdown collection and calculate the required pixel width based on it.
