#onmodelinit-info
The `OnModelInit` event fires before editing and adding new item in the component. The event allows you to:

* bind the component to a class that has no parameterless constructor

* bind the component to an interface

* bind the component to an abstract class

To achieve the desired behavior you can provide an instance of the model that the component is bound to in the `OnModelInit` event handler.
