#grid-treelist-autogenerated-columns-limitation
When the component initializes, it expects to know what columns to render before the data comes.
If the component is bound to a collection of dynamic objects (such as `Dictionary` or `ExpandoObject`), the component cannot know what columns to render, due to the nature of these objects. Therefore, the `AutoGenerateColumns` feature is not applicable in such scenarios. Columns must be declared explicitly or with a loop. Examples of such setups are available at [Binding Grid to ExpandoObject](slug://grid-kb-binding-to-expando-object).
