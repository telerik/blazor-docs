#grid-treelist-autogenerated-columns-limitation
When the component initializes, it expects to know what columns to render before the data comes.
If the component is bound to a collection of dynamic objects (such as `Dictionary` or `ExpandoObject`) due to the nature of such objects and the fact that they can be changed at run time, the component cannot know what columns to render. Therefore, the `AutoGenerateColumns` feature is not applicable in such scenario and should be implemented manually (an example of such a setup is available in our [knowledge base article on Binding a Grid to ExpandoObject]({%slug grid-kb-binding-to-expando-object%})).
