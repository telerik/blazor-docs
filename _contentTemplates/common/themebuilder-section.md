## ThemeBuilder

To take full control over the appearance of the Telerik UI for Blazor components, you can create your own styles by using [ThemeBuilder](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder).

ThemeBuilder is a web application that enables you to create new themes and customize existing ones. Every change that you make is visualized almost instantly. Once you are done styling the UI components, you can export a ZIP file with the styles for your theme and use them in your Blazor app.
