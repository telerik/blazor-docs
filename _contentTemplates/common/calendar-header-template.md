#header-template
The `<HeaderTemplate>` allows you to control the header segment of the calendar. If the application defines this template none of the built-in buttons will rendered. 

You can access the following fields directly through the `context`:
* `Date` - the `DateTime` object that is used for data-binding
* `View` - the current view of the calendar
#end
