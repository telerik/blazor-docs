#data-binding-modes

* [Hierarchical data]({%slug treelist-data-binding-hierarchical-data%}) - separate collections of items and their child items. This is the default mode of the component. See the `Items` setting.

* [Flat data]({%slug treelist-data-binding-flat-data%}) - a single collection of items with defined parent-child relationships. See the `Id` and `ParentId` settings.

In either mode you can also do [Load on Demand]({%slug treelist-data-binding-load-on-demand%}) or lazy loading - that is, provide children to a node when it expands through an event. See the `HasChildren` setting and the `OnExpand` event.
