#data-binding-modes

* [Hierarchical data]({%slug treelist-data-binding-hierarchical-data%}) - separate collections of items and their child items. This is the default mode of the component. See the `Items` and `HasChildren` settings below.

* [Flat data]({%slug treelist-data-binding-flat-data%}) - a single collection of items with defined parent-child relationships. See the `Id`, `ParentId` and `HasChildren` settings below.

* [Load on demand]({%slug treelist-data-binding-load-on-demand%}) or lazy loading - providing children to a node when it expands through an event. Can work with either data binding mode.
