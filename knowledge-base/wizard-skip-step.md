## Description

How to skip one or more Wizard steps, based on the results of another step?

The [Wizard flow is set to linear]({%slug wizard-structure-stepper%}#linear-flow), so I can't disable steps, but I need to skip an unneeded step programmatically, based on a custom condition in a previous step.

## Solution

1. Subscribe to the [`OnChange`]({%slug wizard-events%}#onchange) event of the originating step.
1. Check `args.TargetIndex` to find out if the user is navigating in the desired direction.
1. Set `args.IsCancelled` to `true` to cancel navigation to the next step.
1. Set the Wizard `Value` to the desired step.

Note that Wizard step indexes are zero-based for the developer and 1-based for the end user.
