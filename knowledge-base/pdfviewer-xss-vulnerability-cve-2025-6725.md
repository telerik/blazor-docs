## Description

This is a security notification that explains how to mitigate a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability [CVE-2025-6725](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-6725) in the Telerik PDF Viewer component for Blazor.

* The weakness ID is [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).
* The vulnerability CVSS score is `5.4` (medium).

The XSS vulnerability can be exploited if a specially-crafted document is already loaded and the user engages with a tool that requires the DOM in the PDF Viewer to re-render.

## Solution

If your Blazor app uses the Telerik PDF Viewer, then [upgrading Telerik UI for Blazor](slug:upgrade-tutorial) to version **9.1.0** or later is strongly recommended.

All customers with a Telerik license can:

* Access the [Downloads page in their Telerik account](https://www.telerik.com/account/downloads/product-download).
* Reference [NuGet packages on the Telerik NuGet server](slug:installation/nuget).

## Notes

* If you do not use the PDF Viewer in your application, the application is not vulnerable.
* If you have any questions or concerns related to this issue, [open a new technical support ticket from the Telerik Support Center](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center/contact-us/). Technical support is available to customers with an active license and support plan.
