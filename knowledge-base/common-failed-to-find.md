## Description

I get a `Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource ... with computed SHA-256 integrity ...` error after upgrading the `Telerik.UI.for.Blazor` NuGet package and publishing my Blazor WebAssembly app.

## Error Message

`Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource 'https://.../_framework/Telerik.Recurrence.dll' with computed SHA-256 integrity ... The resource has been blocked.`

`Unknown error occured while trying to verify integrity.`

`Error: Failed to start platform. Reason: TypeError: Failed to fetch`

Other possible resources that may be referred to in the error:
* Telerik.Documents.SpreadsheetStreaming.dll
* Telerik.DataSource.dll
* Telerik.Zip.dll
* Telerik.Blazor.dll
* Telerik.FontIcons.dll
* Telerik.SvgIcons.dll


## Cause

The exception is a general Blazor WebAssembly issue, which can result from the build process, publishing process, or browser cache. The Telerik UI for Blazor components are not related to the problem.

## Solution

The fix for the exception can vary, depending on the cause. Here are some online documentation and discussions on the matter, which suggest possible solutions:
