## Description

This KB article answers the following questions:

* How to display only all-day events in the Scheduler?
* How to show only all-day appointments in a [Timeline View]({%slug scheduler-views-timeline%}) of the Scheduler?
* How to create a multiday scheduler view that only displays the all-day events?

## Solution

To display only all-day events in the Scheduler, apply the following points in your configuration:

1. Use the Timeline View of the `Scheduler`.
2. Set the `SlotDuration` parameter of the `SchedulerTimelineView` to 1440 minutes (one day).
3. Set the `IsAllDay` property of the appointment model to `true`.
