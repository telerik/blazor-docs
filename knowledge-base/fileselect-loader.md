## Description

This KB article answers the following questions:

* How to show progress to end users when using the FileSelect component? Users can select a large number of files at once.
* How to display a loading animation when handling bigger files in the FileSelect? The selection process is slow so how to indicate that the process is ongoing?
* How to show users a progress indicator during file selection?

## Solution

You can use the [`Loader`]({%slug loader-overview%}). Set the [Loader `Visible` parameter]({%slug loader-overview%}#loader-parameters) to `true` in the [FileSelect `OnSelect` event]({%slug fileselect-events%}#onselect). The Loader will display while the files are being handled, so that the app is more user-friendly.

When you show the Loader in a method, which is blocking the UI thread with synchronous operations, the Loader may not appear when expected. To avoid this, add a small delay, which helps Blazor refresh the UI during the `OnSelect` handler execution.

Another option is to use the [`LoaderContainer`]({%slug loadercontainer-overview%}). The benefit is that it can overlay the whole page or [cover part of the page that contains the FileSelect]({%slug loadercontainer-overview%}#fill-a-parent-container).

````CSHTML
<TelerikLoader Visible="@LoaderVisible" />

<TelerikFileSelect OnSelect="@OnSelectHandler" />

@code {
    private bool LoaderVisible { get; set; }

    private async Task OnSelectHandler(FileSelectEventArgs args)
    {
        LoaderVisible = true;

        // allow Blazor to re-render the UI
        await Task.Delay(1);

        foreach (var file in args.Files)
        {
            await HandleFile(file);
        }

        LoaderVisible = false;
    }

    private async Task HandleFile(FileSelectFileInfo file)
    {
        // some long operation here
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
