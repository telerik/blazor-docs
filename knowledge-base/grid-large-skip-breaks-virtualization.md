## Environment
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Product</td>
			<td>Grid for Blazor</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


## Description
We use [virtualization]({%slug components/grid/virtual-scrolling%}) and set the `Skip` of the grid through its [state]({%slug grid-state%})  (for example, to restore state from the user or to scroll the grid programmatically).

When the sum of the skip and the page size is bigger then the total count of the items and we try to set the Skip property for the second time, some of the top items are not shown.

>caption Recording of the problem and the solution (see the code below)

![Setting invalid Skip value breaks the grid virtualization appearance](images/invalid-skip.gif)

## Cause\Possible Cause(s)
The origin of the problem is that when the Skip value is too large, there may not be enough items to fill the grid viewport with data. 

For example, if the grid viewport could fit 15 items, but according to the `Skip` setting that you set there are only 8 items in the `Data`, those items cannot push the placeholder rows out of view, and you will still see them at the top of the grid.

## Solution
Ensure that you set such a `Skip` to the grid so that you don't show placeholders to your user. For example, when the data arrives, check if there are too few items and update the Skip value.

## Notes

The grid cannot make this change for you because that would mean altering the state you provide, which would be invalid and unexpected behavior. Moreover, it could result in infinite loops or errors, and is a heuristic (undetermined) task.
