## Description

gRPC services are becoming more common in various applications and you may want to benefit from them in your Blazor applications as well.


## Solution

The gRPC tooling is compatible with .NET Core and can, therefore, work in Blazor applications. You can find an example of creating a gRPC service and using it to inject models into the Blazor app, then showing data from the service in a grid in the following project: [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/common/grpc-example](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/common/grpc-example)
