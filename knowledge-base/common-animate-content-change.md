## Environment

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Product</td>
            <td>UI for Blazor</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Description

We want to do some animations to show the flow between some razor components.

I want to change content on my page with an animation.

Something like this:

![toggle content with animation](images/toggle-content-with-animation.gif)

## Solution

Animations are best done in CSS (such as CSS3 transitions) or JavaScript. Blazor does not do animations in C# very well, because they are a CSS/JavaScript feature and so the C# part can usually react when it starts or ends (for JS), or control its start when it is a CSS transition through a CSS class. Thus, components that animate would usually wait for one animation to end before they can start the next (this is the behavior of `async Task` methods).

        overflow: hidden;

    /*inner layout - uses widths to show and hide the content in the flex layout*/
        .the-container .expanded {
            width: 100%;
        }

        .the-container .collapsed {
            width: 0%;
        }

        .the-container .content {
            transition: width 700ms ease-in-out;
