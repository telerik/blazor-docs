## Environment

		</tr>
	</tbody>

## Description
I observe twice firing onchange event in dropdownlist.

I want the event to fire only once when the user selects something.

## Cause\Possible Cause(s)
The OnChange event is a user confirmation event - it fires when the user chooses an item from the dropdown list, and also when the user blurs an input (the dropdownlist is, in essence, an input).

## Solution
If you want to execute some business logic (such as fetching data) only once per value change, but you want to keep using the `@bind-Value` to populate your models, you can keep the last value with which `OnChange` fired and compare against it.

>caption Execute OnChange once per value selection

````CSHTML
@* monitor the console and try the following to see the difference:
    - selecting the same item several times
    - clicking away from the dropdownlist after selecting an item
    *@

@MySelectedItem
<br />
<TelerikDropDownList Data="@MyList" OnChange="@MyOnChangeHandler" @bind-Value="@MySelectedItem">
</TelerikDropDownList>

@code {
    string MySelectedItem { get; set; }
    protected List<string> MyList = new List<string>() { "first", "second", "third" };
    
    string lastOnChangeValue { get; set; }

    void MyOnChangeHandler(object theUserInput)
    {
        string currValue = theUserInput as string;

        Console.WriteLine($"OnChange fired for value: {currValue}");

        if (!currValue.Equals(lastOnChangeValue))
        {
            //this is where you execute the business logic you want to fire once per selected value
            Console.WriteLine($"Executing business logic for value {currValue}, such as loading data");
        }

        lastOnChangeValue = currValue;
    }
}
