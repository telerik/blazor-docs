## Description

This KB article answers the following questions:

* Which Telerik UI for Blazor components to use to create layouts?
* How to build page layouts with Telerik Blazor components and without using third-party tools like Bootstrap?
* What are the Bootstrap framework alternatives in Telerik UI for Blazor?


## Solution

If you want to build layouts only with Telerik UI for Blazor, there are several components that can serve this purpose. Here are some pointers to help you compare and choose:

* The [Form](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/form/overview) supports built-in horizontal and vertical orientation of the labels and editors. You can also split form items in groups or organize the form layout in columns. Finally, the Form can generate input components for your model automatically.
* The [GridLayout](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/gridlayout/overview) displays items in rows and columns, similar to the CSS grid layout.
* The [MediaQuery](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/mediaquery/overview) can help you reach to viewport size changes and render different layout depending on the screen size (even replace entire rendering and components, not just hide elements with CSS).
* The [Splitter](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/splitter/overview) is useful for organizing the whole page in areas, for example - header, left content, right content, footer. Splitter panes can be collapsed and resized.
* The [StackLayout](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/stacklayout/overview) displays cards in a single row or column with some spacing options.
* The [TileLayout](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/tilelayout/overview) displays tiles that are resizable and reorderable.

Other components that may be relevant to application layouts are:

* The [Card](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/card/overview) lets you display items and sets of information through predefined building blocks.
* [Various popup components]({%slug common-kb-popup-component-comparison%}) let you conserve real estate on the screen.
* Many other components help with navigation and layouts, review the [list of available components in our demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui).
