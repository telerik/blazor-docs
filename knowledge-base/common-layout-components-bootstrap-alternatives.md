## Solution

### Bootstrap Framework Alternatives

If you do not want to use the Bootstrap framework to create your layouts, there are several components from the Telerik UI for Blazor suite that can serve similar purposes. Below you will find some examples to get you started:

* The [Form](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/form/overview) supports built-in horizontal and vertical orientation of the labels and editors. You can also split form items in groups or organize the form layout in columns. Finally, the Form can generate input components for your model automatically.
* The [GridLayout](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/gridlayout/overview) displays items in rows and columns, similar to the CSS grid layout.
* The [MediaQuery](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/mediaquery/overview) can help you reach to viewport size changes and render different layout depending on the screen size (even replace entire rendering and components, not just hide elements with CSS).
* The [Splitter](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/splitter/overview) is useful for organizing the whole page in areas, for example - header, left content, right content, footer. Splitter panes can be collapsed and resized.
* The [StackLayout](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/stacklayout/overview) displays cards in a single row or column with some spacing options.
* The [TileLayout](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/tilelayout/overview) displays tiles that are resizable and reorderable.

Other components that may be relevant to application layouts are:

* [Cards](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/card/overview) let you add quick and easy distinction and styling between items in sets of information.
* [Various popup components]({%slug common-kb-popup-component-comparison%}) let you conserve real estate on the screen.


* Many other components help with navigation and layouts, review the [list of available components in our demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui).
