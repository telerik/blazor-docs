## Description
An app needs to process data for the month - is there a way to use DatePicker and choose only the Month/Year? Displaying it is quite easy with Format.

Is it possible to get a DatePicker that shows a popup with only month/year selection?

## Solution
You can use the `BottomView` to limit how far down the user can go to. If they can go down only to the Year view they will effectively select months.

You can also set a `Format` that shows the month and year only too.

Here is an example of both:

 
````RAZOR
@selectedDate
<br />
<TelerikDatePicker @bind-Value="@selectedDate"
                   BottomView="@CalendarView.Year"
                   Format="MMM yy">
</TelerikDatePicker>

@code{
    DateTime selectedDate { get; set; } = DateTime.Now;
}
````
