## Description

This KB article answers the following questions:

* What are the differences between the Dialog and the Window component? Dialog vs Window comparison.
* What are the differences between the Popover and the Tooltip? Popover vs Tooltip comparison.
* When should you use one popup component over another?


## Solution

Here are the unique features and distinguishing characteristics of all Telerik UI for Blazor popup components:

* The [AnimationContainer]({%slug components/animationcontainer/overview%}) is a blank animated element that [renders at the same place where it is declared]({%slug components/animationcontainer/overview%}#position). The rendering location can matter a lot in some cases, for example, in scenarios with scrollable conatiners.
* The [Dialog]({%slug dialog-overview%}) and [Window]({%slug window-overview%}) are very similar. Basically, the Dialog is a modal Window that cannot be resized or dragged. The Dialog has [built-in layouts for action buttons in its footer]({%slug dialog-action-buttons%}).
* The [Popover]({%slug popover-overview%}) and [Tooltip]({%slug tooltip-overview%}) are also similar. The Popover is designed to work with a single anchor (target), while the Tooltip works with multiple targets. Both components can show a callout. Similar to the [Dialog]({%slug dialog-overview%}), the Popover supports action buttons in its footer.
* The [Popup]({%slug popup-overview%}) UX can be similar to a [Window]({%slug window-overview%}) or a drop down, depending on its animation and position settings. Similar to the [Popover]({%slug popover-overview%}), the Popup also works with a single anchor and is positioned relative to it. The Popup has the [most comprehensive set of parameters that position and align it to its anchor]({%slug popup-position-collision%}). Use the Popup to implement custom drop down components, which do not exist in the product.

The following table provides another point of view for easier comparison.

>caption Component Comparison

| Component | Rendering Location * | Position Relative To | Anchor Elements | Built-in Styled Content | Modality | Resizing and Dragging |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AnimationContainer | in-place | depends on positioned containers and [`Top` and `Left`]({%slug components/animationcontainer/overview%}#position) | 0, but can be simulated | none | no | no |
| Dialog | root | page | 0 | header with [optional close button]({%slug dialog-overview%}#dialog-parameters), footer with action buttons | yes | no |
| Popover | root | anchor element | 1, [limited support for multiple](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/popover/overview) | header, footer with action buttons, callout | no | no |
| Popup | root | anchor element | 1 | none | no | no |
| Tooltip | root | anchor element | unlimited | icons, callout | no | no |
| Window | depends on [`ContainmentSelector`]({%slug components/window/position%}#containmentselector) | page | 0 | header with actions | depends on [`Modal`]({%slug components/window/modal%}) | yes |

\* **Root** rendering location means as a direct child of the [`TelerikRootComponent`]({%slug rootcomponent-overview%}). **In-place** is how Blazor components normally work.
