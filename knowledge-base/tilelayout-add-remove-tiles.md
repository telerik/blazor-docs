## Environment
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Product</td>
			<td>TileLayout for Blazor</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


## Description

I would like to allow users to hide/remove TileLayoutItems via an 'X' button in the header and be able to re-add them from a separate list.


## Solution

This sample project in the blazor-ui repository demonstrates how to achieve such a scenario - [Add and Remove Tiles](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/tilelayout/add-remove-tiles).
It showcases a simple customizable dashboard which uses TileLayout component and allows adding and removing tiles from a collection to display the desired set of data in the main section.
