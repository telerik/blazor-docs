## Description
All of our Models are Generated via EF Scaffolding. We need to be able to specify our Validation criteria using the [MetadataTypeAttribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.metadatatypeattribute?view=net-5.0) and partial classes, but the validation is not honored in the Telerik components.

## Cause\Possible Cause(s)
The grid needs to create a new instance of the model for inserting or editing, and the only way to do that is to use `Activator.CreateInstance()`. This does not take into account the custom metadata type from the partial classes however, so the model that it returns does not have data annotations at all, and so - no validation or other attributes.

>caption You can reproduce this behavior with the following simplistic markup without any Telerik components.

````CSHTML
@using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

<EditForm Model="@cust" OnValidSubmit="@ValidSubmit">
    <DataAnnotationsValidator />
    <ValidationSummary />

    <InputText @bind-Value="@cust.Title"></InputText>

    <button type="submit">VALIDATE</button>
</EditForm>

@code{
    Customer cust { get; set; }

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        //this mimics what the grid does to get an instance of the model to be edited/inserted
        cust = Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(Customer)) as Customer;

        base.OnInitialized();
    }

    void ValidSubmit()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Valid submit");
    }

    // partial class from the app to point to custom metadata class
    [MetadataType(typeof(CustomerMetaData))]
    public partial class Customer
    {

    }

    // the custom metadata class
    public class CustomerMetaData
    {
        [Required(ErrorMessage = "Title is required.")]
        public object Title;
    }

    // mockup of what could be generated by EF
    public partial class Customer
    {
        public string Title { get; set; }
    }
}
````

## Suggested Workarounds
The Telerik components cannot get an instance of the model in any other way, so there can be two potential options:

* Create a custom edit form ([inline](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/editing-custom-form) or [popup](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/custom-popup-form)) where you can implement the model generation and validation as required in a way that works for your project.

* If you have the same models and can create an instance that has the desired validation, you can try setting it through the [grid state]({%slug grid-state%}) to initiate insertion or editing for a particular model instance, rather than let the grid create it.
