## Description

I want to export the Telerik Blazor [Grid]({%slug grid-overview%})'s column that displays images to an Excel file. The images are rendered in a [Grid column template]({%slug grid-templates-column%}). How can I include the image column in the Excel export?

## Solution

To export an image column from the Grid to Excel, follow these steps:

1. Handle the Grid's [`OnAfterExport` event]({%slug grid-export-events%}#onafterexport) to capture the Excel export output as a memory stream.
2. Use the [SpreadProcessing library](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radspreadprocessing/overview) to modify the Excel file. Similar to how the exported file is customized here - [Custom cell formatting of the exported file with RadSpreadProcessing]({%slug grid-kb-custom-cell-formatting-with-radspreadprocessing%}). The SpreadProcessing library supports [inserting images in the cells](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radspreadprocessing/features/shapes-and-images).

If you encounter any questions regarding the usage of the Document Processing libraries, [contact the DocumentPorcessing team](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/knowledge-base/submit-support-tickets).
