## Environment
<table>

		<tr>
			<td>Product</td>
			<td>DropDownList for Blazor, ComboBox for Blazor, AutoComplete for Blazor, TextBox for Blazor, NumericTextBox for Blazor</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


## Description

I observe twice firing `OnChange` event in the DropDownList or other inputs.

I want the event to fire only once when the user selects something.

I want to execute my business logic in the `OnChange` event handler only once per value change.

## Possible Cause

The `OnChange` event is a user confirmation event - it fires when the user chooses an item from the DropDownList popup, and also when the user blurs an input (the DropDownList is, in essence, an input).

For example, pressing Enter in an input will fire the event, but will not remove the focus from the input. Thus, the next click on the page (on a button, another component) will fire the event again.

## Solution

1. Create an additional variable.
1. In the `OnChange` event handler:
    * Get the user input from the `OnChange` event argument or from the `Value` parameter.
    * Compare the input with the additionally created variable.
    * Execute your business logic only when the additional variable and the input are not the same.
    * Overwrite the additional variable with the input.

With this approach you will keep the last value with which `OnChange` fired, compare against it and execute your business logic only once when there is an actual value change.

````CSHTML
@* monitor the console and try the following to see the difference:
    - selecting the same item several times
    - clicking away from the DropDownList after selecting an item

@DropDownValue
<br />
<TelerikDropDownList Data="@DropDownData"
                     @bind-Value="@DropDownValue"
                     OnChange="@OnChangeHandler">
</TelerikDropDownList>

@code {
    private string DropDownValue { get; set; }

    private List<string> DropDownData = new List<string>() { "first", "second", "third" };

    private string lastOnChangeValue { get; set; }

    private async Task OnChangeHandler(object theUserInput)
    {
        string currValue = theUserInput as string;

        Console.WriteLine($"OnChange fired for value: {currValue}");

        if (!currValue.Equals(lastOnChangeValue))
        {
            //save the changed value first, so the check does not pass afterwards
            lastOnChangeValue = currValue;

            //this is where you execute the business logic you want to fire once per selected value
            await Task.Delay(2000); //simulate some asynchronous operation, e.g. loading data

            Console.WriteLine($"Executing business logic for value {currValue}, such as loading data");
        }
    }
}

>tip As of `2.22.0`, you can use the `OnBlur` event of the components to capture the `focusout` event, so you may not need to use `OnChange`.
