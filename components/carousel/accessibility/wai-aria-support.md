# Blazor Carousel Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor Carousel provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Carousel is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-scrollview` | `role=application` | Specifies the role of the Carousel element. |
|  | `aria-roledescription=carousel` | Clarifies the role of the Carousel element. |
|  | `tabindex=0` | Carousel element must be focusable. |

| `.k-scrollview>.k-sr-only` | `aria-live=polite` | Identifies a hidden element as a live region in the `polite` state, meaning assistive technology users are informed about changes to the region at the next available opportunity. |
|  | `aria-live=off` | Identifies a hidden element as a live region that is in the `off` state, meaning assistive technology users are not informed about changes to the region. |
| `.k-scrollview-wrap>*` | `role=listitem` | Specifies the role of each Carousel item. |
|  | `aria-roledescription=slide` | Clarifies the role of the Carousel item. |
