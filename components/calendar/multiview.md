# Multiple Views

You can render several instances of the current calendar view next to each other so that the user needs to browse less. To do that, set the `Views` property to the desired count of views.

>caption Render 3 months (a quarter) at a time

````CSHTML
<TelerikCalendar Views="3" View="CalendarView.Month">
</TelerikCalendar>
````

Additionally, you may configure the orientation of the views through the `Orientation` parameter of the Calendar. It takes a member of the `CalendarOrientation` enum and defaults to `Horizontal`.

>caption Render 2 months at a time with vertical orientation

````CSHTML
<TelerikCalendar Orientation="@CalendarOrientation.Vertical"
                 Views="2"
                 View="CalendarView.Month">
</TelerikCalendar>
````

>tip You can still use the other features of the calendar like setting a starting `Date` and [Selection](selection), or the `Min` and `Max` constraints.
