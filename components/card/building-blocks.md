# Card Building Blocks

The Card component supports a variety of template-based components used as building blocks. All building blocks can be rendered as root level elements of the Card and therefore can be used as desired with no restriction in their place of declaration or requirement for the Card structure. The elements can also be nested inside each other.


* [`CardHeader`](#cardheader) - renders header area, useful for title, subtitle, etc. Has a separator after itself.

* [`CardBody`](#cardbody) - renders the body of the card with added paddings.

* [`CardFooter`](#cardfooter) -  renders footer area separated from the content through a separator.

* [`CardImage`](#cardimage) - renders card image to fill the size of the card. Read more in the [Card Image article]({%slug card-image%}).

* [`CardActions`](#cardactions) - renders dedicated area for actions. Read more in the [Actions article]({%slug card-actions%}).

* [`CardSeparator`](#cardseparator) - renders a horizontal line. Read more in the [Card Separator]({%slug card-separator%}) article.

* [`CardTitle`](#cardtitle) - renders div title with default theme styling.

* [`CardSubTitle`](#cardsubtitle) - renders div title with default theme styling as sub title.

        <TelerikButton Class="k-flat">Action 2</TelerikButton>
    </CardActions>
    
</TelerikCard>
````

>caption Use `CardSeparator` in the Card component. The result from the snippet below.

![Card Separator](images/card-separator-example.png)

````CSHTML
@* Card Separator *@

<TelerikCard Width="200px">
    <CardBody>        
        <p> Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card content.</p>
        
        <CardSeparator></CardSeparator>
        
        <p>Some other text in the Card Body after the separator.</p>
    </CardBody>
    
    <CardSeparator></CardSeparator>
    
    <CardActions Layout="CardActionsLayout.Center">
        <TelerikButton Class="k-flat">Action 1</TelerikButton>
        
        <CardSeparator Orientation="CardOrientation.Vertical"></CardSeparator>
        
        <TelerikButton Class="k-flat">Action 2</TelerikButton>
    </CardActions>
</TelerikCard>
````

## CardTitle

Use the `CardTitle` tag to render a title (heading). Although the header area is suitable for placing title, it is not required and you can use the `CardTitle` as desired. The below sample demonstrates implementation of a title in three different sections.

>caption Use `CardTitle` in the Card component. The result from the snippet below.

![Card Footer](images/card-title-example.png)

````CSHTML
@* Card Title *@

<TelerikCard Width="200px">

    <CardTitle>This is standalone Title </CardTitle>

    <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>This is Title in the Card Header</CardTitle>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardBody>
        <CardTitle>This is Title in the Card Body</CardTitle>
        <p> Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card content.</p>
    </CardBody>
</TelerikCard>
````


## CardSubTitle

Use the `CardSubTitle` tag to render sub title. Although the header area is suitable for placing title and sub title, it is not required and you can use the `CardSubTitle` as desired. It can also be used along with the `CardTitle` or as a standalone element. The below sample demontstrates both approaches.

>caption Use `CardSubTitle` in the Card component. The result from the snippet below.

![Card Footer](images/card-subtitle-example.png)

````CSHTML
@* Card Subtitle *@

<TelerikCard Width="200px">
    <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>This is Title in the Card Header</CardTitle>
        
        <CardSubTitle>This is Subtitle in the Card Header along with Title</CardSubTitle>
    
    </CardHeader>
    <CardBody>
    
        <CardSubTitle><strong>Just Subtitle in the Card Body</strong></CardSubTitle>
    
        <p> Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card content.</p>
    </CardBody>  
</TelerikCard>
