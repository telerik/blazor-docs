# Blazor Card Overview

The <a href = "https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/card" target="_blank">Card for Blazor</a> is a component that combines text, visual content and actions about a single subject. It quickly grabs the userâ€™s attention with its clean layout, consisting of a title, usually an image, some text as the body and perhaps a footer. You can use it to easily organize content when building catalogs, dashboards, blogs, e-shops, etc. It has dedicated areas for its [building blocks]({%slug card-building-blocks%}) and that provides various ways of component usage.

## Basics

To use a Telerik Card for Blazor:

## Features

The Card provides the following features:

* `Width` - `string` - defines width of the component.

* `Class` - `string` - the CSS class that will be rendered on the main wrapping element of the Card.

* `Orientation` - `CardOrientation` - defines the orientation of the card. Takes a member of the `Telerik.Blazor.CardOrientation` enum (`Horizontal` or `Vertical`). Read more in the [Card Orientation article]({%slug card-orientation%}).

* `ThemeColor` - `string` - defines the appearance of the component. We support predefined theme colors such as info, error, success (members of the `Telerik.Blazor.ThemeColors` class). Test changing the Card theme colors in our [live demo](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/card/appearance).

* `ChildContent` - `RenderFragment` - defines the child content of the component. All possible building blocks can be directly used as a `ChildContent` of the Card.

>tip To make multiple Cards occupy the same **height** automatically, use the predefined [Deck or Group layouts]({%slug card-layouts%}). If the Cards should wrap to multiple rows, use the custom [Tile layout](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/card/data-cards). It is also possible to set a specific height to Cards with a CSS rule.
