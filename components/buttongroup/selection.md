# ButtonGroup Selection

The ButtonGroup lets you select one or more of its `ButtonGroupToggleButton` instances depending on the `SelectionMode` setting:

* [Single](#single-selection) (default) - the buttons act like radio buttons
* [Multiple](#multiple-selection) - the buttons act like checkboxes

You can control whether a button is selected (it is in its `Primary` state) through its `Selected` parameter. It offers two-way binding and an [SelectedChanged event]({%slug buttongroup-events%}) so you can respond to the user actions.

## Single Selection

When you click a button, it becomes selected. When you click another button, the first one will become de-selected and the second one will be selected.

    <ButtonGroupToggleButton @bind-Selected="@SecondSelected">Second</ButtonGroupToggleButton>

}

@if (ThirdSelected)

    <div class="alert alert-success">third</div>
}

@code{
    bool FirstSelected { get; set; }
    bool SecondSelected { get; set; } = true; // you can pre-select buttons
    bool ThirdSelected { get; set; }
}

## Multiple Selection

When you click a button, it becomes selected. When you click another button, the first one retains its selected state, and the second one will also be selected. Clicking on a selected button will deselect it.
