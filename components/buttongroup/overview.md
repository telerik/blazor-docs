# Blazor ButtonGroup Overview

This article provides information about the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/buttongroup" target="_blank">Blazor ButtonGroup component</a> and its core features.

The ButtonGroup component is a container for [regular and toggle buttons]({%slug buttongroup-buttons%}). Before continuing, make sure you are familiar with the differences between [regular buttons]({%slug components/button/overview%}) and [toggle buttons]({%slug togglebutton-overview%}).

The ButtonGroup component lets you [select one or more toggle buttons]({%slug buttongroup-selection%}), and respond to the [selection and click events]({%slug buttongroup-events%}). The buttons inside fill up the container, match the styling according to the [chosen theme]({%slug general-information/themes%}) and provide the regular button features like images and icons and the other parameters and attributes. 

## Creating Blazor ButtonGroup

1. Use the `<TelerikButtonGroup>` tag to add the component to your razor page.
1. Inside it, add the desired [button tags]({%slug buttongroup-buttons%}) that denote each button - `<ButtonGroupToggleButton>` or `<ButtonGroupButton>`.
1. Optionally, use the `OnClick` event of these buttons to handle the user actions. Read more in the [Events]({%slug buttongroup-events%}) article.

<TelerikButtonGroup>

</TelerikButtonGroup>

@code{
    async Task FirstClick()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("the first button was clicked.");
    }

    async Task SecondClick()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("the second button was clicked. It becomes selected when clicked.");
    }
}

## Buttons

The ButtonGroup incorporates two types of buttons - `ButtonGroupToggleButton` and `ButtonGroupButton`. You can individually configure their settings, control their enabled/disabled state and visibility. [Read more about the Blazor ButtonGroup buttons...]({%slug buttongroup-buttons%})
