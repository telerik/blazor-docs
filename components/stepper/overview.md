# Stepper Overview

The Stepper for Blazor is a component that renders a path formed by a sequence of logical steps towards a bigger action. The stepper indicates the userâ€™s progress within this action by showing the steps left for them to complete it. It makes the user experience less overwhelming as it breaks the long process into smaller parts and should have an option to be configured whether going back and forth through the steps is allowed. Besides using it as standalone component, the Stepper will also become an integral part of the Wizard component.
