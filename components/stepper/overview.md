# Blazor Stepper Overview

The <a href ="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/stepper"><strong>Stepper for Blazor</strong></a> is a component that renders a path formed by a sequence of logical steps towards a bigger action. The Stepper indicates the userâ€™s progress within this action by showing the steps left for them to complete it. It makes the user experience less overwhelming as it breaks the long process into smaller parts.

The Stepper provides several features out of the box, including the ability to define the appearance of each [step]({%slug stepper-steps-overview%}), [validation]({%slug stepper-steps-validation%}) for the steps, strict [linear flow]({%slug stepper-linear-flow%}) and [step template]({%slug step-template%}) to make the it fit any design requirements.
