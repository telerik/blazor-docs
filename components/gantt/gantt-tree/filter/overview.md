# Blazor Filtering Overview

The Grid component offers built-in support for filtering.

To enable filtering, set the grid's `FilterMode` property to one of the following values:

* [`Telerik.Blazor.GanttFilterMode.FilterRow`]({%slug gantt-filter-row%}) - a row of filter options is rendered below the column headers

* [`Telerik.Blazor.GanttFilterMode.FilterMenu`]({%slug gantt-filter-menu%}) - the column headers render a button that shows a popup with filtering options

The behavior of the filter input and the available filter operators will depend on the column data type. For example, a `boolean` field will only have the options `"is true"` and `"is false"` and will not have operators like `"contains"` or `"greater than"`.

You can filter more than one column at a time, and all filter rules will be applied together with an `AND` logic.
