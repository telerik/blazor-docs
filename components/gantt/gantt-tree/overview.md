# Gantt Tree

The Gantt Tree is the left part of the [Gantt Chart](slug://gantt-overview). The component exposes `TreeListWidth` (string, default `30`) parameter for changing the width of the TreeList pane in the splitter. 

Set data to the component through its [data binding](slug://gantt-data-binding-overview) options. You can also use the [filtering](slug://gantt-filtering-overview), [sorting](slug://gantt-sorting), and [editing](slug://gantt-tree-editing) capabilities of the Telerik Gantt for Blazor.
