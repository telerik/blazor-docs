# Tree

The Gantt Tree is the left part of the [Gantt Chart]({%slug gantt-overview%}). You can provide data to the component through its [data binding]({%slug gantt-data-binding-overview%}) options. You can also use the [filtering]({%slug gantt-filtering-overview%}), [sorting]({%slug gantt-sorting%}), and [editing]({%gantt-tree-editing%}) capabilities of the Telerik Gantt for Blazor.

## List of available feature for the Gantt Tree
