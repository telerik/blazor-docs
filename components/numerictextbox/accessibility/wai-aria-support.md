# Blazor NumericTextBox Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor NumericTextBox provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The NumericTextBox is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-input-inner` | `role=spinbutton` | Announces the spin button capabilities of the NumericTextBox. |
|  | `label for` or `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The input requires an accessible name that will be assigned to it. |
|  | `aria-required=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the NumericTextBox is in a `form` HTML element and announces the required state of the component. |
|  | `aria-describedby=.k-form-hint id/.k-form-error id` | Points to the hint for the input, or if the input is invalid, to the error message. This attribute should only be present when a hint is set or when the input is invalid. |
|  | `aria-valuemnow` | Announces the value for the component. |
|  | `aria-valuemin` | Announces the minimum value allowed for the component. |
|  | `aria-valuemax` | Announces the maximum value allowed for the component. |
|  | `aria-invalid=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the NumericTextBox is in a form and announces the valid state of the component. |
| `.k-disabled .k-input-inner` | `disabled=disabled` or `aria-disabled=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the NumericTextBox is disabled. |
| `.k-spin-button>.k-button` | `role=button` or `nodeName=button` | Announces the spin button capabilities of the NumericTextBox. |
|  | `aria-label` | The button element must have discernible text. |
