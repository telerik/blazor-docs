@* Setup a basic linear gauge *@

<TelerikLinearGauge>
    <LinearGaugePointers>
        <LinearGaugePointer Value="30" />
    </LinearGaugePointers>
</TelerikLinearGauge>

## Features

The Telerik Linear Gauge for Blazor exposes the following features:

#### Linear Gauge Size

* `Width` - `string` - controls the width of the component. You can read more on how they work in the [Dimensions]({%slug common-features/dimensions%}) article.

* `Height` - `string` - controls the height of the component. You can read more on how they work in the [Dimensions]({%slug common-features/dimensions%}) article.

You can also set the Gauge size in percentage values so it occupies its container when it renderes. If the parent container size changes, you must call the gauge's `Refresh()` C# [method](#methods) after the DOM has been redrawn and the new container dimensions are rendered.

#### Other Feautres

* `Class` - renders a custom CSS class on the topmost wrapping element of the component. You can use that class to reposition the component on the page.

* Scale - The scale of the linear gauge renders the values of the [pointers]({%slug linear-gauge-pointers%}), different [ranges]({%slug linear-gauge-ranges%}) and [labels]({%slug linear-gauge-ranges%}). See the [Scale]({%slug linear-gauge-scale%}) article for more information on how to customize the scale of the component.

* Ranges - The ranges are used to visually distinguish particular values on the scale. See the [Ranges]({%slug linear-gauge-ranges%}) article for more information on how to provide ranges for the scale of the component.

* Labels - The labels are rendered on the scale of the component to give information to the users. See the [Labels]({%slug linear-gauge-labels%}) article for more information on how to customize the labels on the scale of the component.

* Pointers - The pointers indicate the values on the scale of the component. See the [Pointers]({%slug linear-gauge-pointers%}) article for more information on how to customize the pointers of the component.

## Methods

The Linear Gauge reference exposes the `Refresh` method which allows you to programatically re-render the component. 

>caption Get a component reference and use the Refresh method

````CSHTML
@* Change the Height of the component *@

<TelerikButton OnClick="@ChangeTheHeight">Change the Height of the component</TelerikButton>

<TelerikLinearGauge @ref="@LinearGaugeRef" Height="@Height">
    <LinearGaugePointers>
    
        <LinearGaugePointer Value="30" />
        
    </LinearGaugePointers>
</TelerikLinearGauge>

@code {
    Telerik.Blazor.Components.TelerikLinearGauge LinearGaugeRef { get; set; }

    public string Height { get; set; } = "300px";

    private async Task ChangeTheHeight()
    {
        Height = "450px";
        // Refresh() may execute before OnParameterSet(). The delay avoids this.
        await Task.Delay(1);
        LinearGaugeRef.Refresh();
    }
}
