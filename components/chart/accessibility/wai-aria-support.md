# Blazor Chart Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor Chart provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Chart is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The Chart is an interactive Graphics Document (https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/#graphics-document). All actions available for mouse users are also available via keyboard shortcuts.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-chart` | `role=graphics-document` | Indicates that the Chart element is a Graphics Document. |
|  | `aria-roledescription` | User-set value that clarifies the type of Chart to screen reader users. |
|  | `aria-label` | Announces the user-set title of the Chart. |
| `.k-chart-point` | `role=graphics-symbol` | Specifies the role of the series point elements. |
|  | `aria-roledescription=Point` | Describes the role of the series point elements. |
| `.k-chart-legend-item` | `role=checkbox` | Specifies the role of the legend item element. |
|  | `aria-label` | Specifies the name of the series associated with this legend item. |
|  | `aria-roledescription=Legend item` | Specifies the name of the series associated with this legend item. |
