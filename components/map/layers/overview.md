# Map Layers

The information that the Map renders is organized into layers. These layers are stacked from bottom to top in the order of definition and are oblivious of each other.

>tip We recommend you define only one instance of a layer type. The component does not allow multiple layers of the same type.

## Supported Layer Types

The layers in the Map are:

* [Tile]({%slug components/map/layers/tile%})
* [Marker]({%slug components/map/layers/marker%})
* [Shape]({%slug components/map/layers/shape%})
* [Bubble]({%slug components/map/layers/bubble%})
