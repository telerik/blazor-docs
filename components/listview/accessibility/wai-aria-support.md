# Blazor ListView Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor ListView provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The ListView is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AAA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-listview:not(.k-selectable) .k-listview-content` | `role=list` | Specifies the role of non selectable ListView content element. |
| `.k-listview.k-selectable .k-listview-content` | `role=listbox` | Specifies the role of selectable ListView content element. |
| `.k-listview:not(.k-selectable) .k-listview-item` | `role=listitem` | Specifies the role of each item in a non selectable ListView. |

|  | `aria-posinset` | Specifies the position of the current item in the entire list of items present in the ListView. Value must be greated than or equal to 1 and smaller than or equal to the total number of items in the ListView. |
| `.k-listview-item:nth-child(1)` | `tabindex=0` | The first item in the ListView must be focusable by default. |
