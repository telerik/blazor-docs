# Month View

The Month view of the Scheduler for Blazor shows the entire month to the user.

The `Date` parameter of the scheduler controls which month is displayed - the one containing the date.

A day shows up to two events and if there are more - an ellipsis button provides access to the DayView for the specific day so the user can see the needed details. This avoids cluttering and ugly rendering. You can also access the day view from the day number. Of course, you must also define a day view so the use can see it.

## Example

>caption Declare the Month and Day Views in the markup

>tip You can declare other views as well, this example adds only the month and day views for brevity.

@* Define the month view. The screenshot above is the result from this code snippet
    This example also shows how to add a day view so the user can see details for busy days with more than 2 events*@

## Resource Grouping in the Month View

You can configure the Month view to display events that are [grouped by a resource]({%slug scheduler-resource-grouping%}).
