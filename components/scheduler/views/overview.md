# Scheduler Views

The Scheduler component provides several different modes of display to fit different user preferences and needs.

You can choose which views the user can switch between. To do that, declare the desired views in the `SchedulerViews` tag (conditional markup is allowed).

You can also control which is the default one through the `View` parameter. You should usually use it in the `@bind-View` syntax to prevent it from resetting to its initial view when re-rendering happens.

You can read more about this in the [Navigation]({%slug scheduler-navigation%}) article.

The available views are:

* [Scheduler**Day**View]({%slug scheduler-views-day%})
* [Scheduler**MultiDay**View]({%slug scheduler-views-multiday%})
* [Scheduler**Week**View]({%slug scheduler-views-week%})
* [Scheduler**Month**View]({%slug scheduler-views-month%})
* [Scheduler**Timeline**View]({%slug scheduler-views-timeline%})

>caption Allow the user to navigate between Day and Week views only by defining only them. Example how to choose starting View (Week) and Date (29 Nov 2019).

@* The user can only choose the Day and Week views - the MultiDay view, for example, is not defined *@
