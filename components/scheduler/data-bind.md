# Scheduler Appointments Data Binding

The Scheduler component is designed to work with a collection of appointments. This article will explain their basic features.

In this article:

* [Appointment Features](#appointment-features)
* [Built-in Validation](#built-in-validation)
* [Examples](#examples)



## Appointment Features

The scheduler appointments provide the following features that you control through the corresponding fields in their data binding. The appointment model needs to provide all fields from the list below.

* `Id` - (`object`) - a unique identifier for an appointment. Useful for finding appointments in a collection, and required for recurring appointments. The scheduler uses it to establish a relationship between a recurring appointment and its exceptions. Must be something that can be uniquely compared, like a `Guid`.

* `Title` - (`string`) - this is what is shown in the main scheduler view so the user can identify the event.

* `Start` - (`DateTime`) - the date and time at which the appointment starts.

* `End` - (`DateTime`) - the date and time at which the appointment ends.

* `Description` - (`string`) - detailed description of the event. Shown in the edit form.

* `IsAllDay` - (`bool`) - whether the event is shown in the all-day slot in the applicable views. Such events are not rendered in a specific time interval (slot), but are always shown when their day is visible.

* `RecurrenceRule` - (`string`) - the recurrence rule for a recurring appointment according to the [rfc5545 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10). Present only for a recurring appointment, but not for an exception from it. In the data source, there is only one item that determines a recurring event, and the scheduler expands it to render the necessary number of appointments in the UI.

* `RecurrenceExceptions` - (`List<DateTime>`) - a list with the exceptions for a recurring appointment. It tells the scheduler when to skip rendering a recurring appointment because its instance is explicitly changed and is an exception to the recurrence rule.

* `RecurrenceId` - (`object`) - the unique identifier of the recurring appointment to which the current appointment is an exception. Must be of the same type as the `Id` field (e.g., a `Guid`). Present only for an exception from a recurrence, but not for the recurring appointment itself.

>tip The list above shows the default field names for data binding. If your model uses the same field names, you don't have to set the field names explicitly. Otherwise, the `<Property>Field` parameters of the scheduler must be set to point to the field names of the model.

>caption Sample model with default field names

````CSHTML
    public class SchedulerAppointment
    {
        public Guid Id { get; set; }
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Description { get; set; }
        public DateTime Start { get; set; }
        public DateTime End { get; set; }
        public bool IsAllDay { get; set; }
        public string RecurrenceRule { get; set; }
        public List<DateTime> RecurrenceExceptions { get; set; }
        public Guid? RecurrenceId { get; set; }

        // a constructor that generated a unique ID. You don't have to
        // have one, but it may be helpful to extract this into the model
        // instead of having it as part of a view-model or a service.
        // You should determine its type and setting logic according to your application
        public SchedulerAppointment()
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid();
        }
    }
````

>tip You are not limited to using these fields only. Your model can carry additional information that will be used by your application logic.


##  Built-in Validation

By default, the scheduler requires that an appointment has:

* title - this is what is rendered for the user to see
* start time - so the scheduler can know where to render it
* end time - so the scheduler can know where it ends

The built-in edit form also enforces that the end time is after the start time.

The scheduler edit form works with an instance that that the scheduler creates from the provided model from its data source. This means that custom validation rules (attributes) in the model will not be used by the scheduler. To implement custom validation logic, implement a custom edit form. Make sure that the same three fields, at minimum, are required and available in the appointments you store, otherwise errors may be thrown.
