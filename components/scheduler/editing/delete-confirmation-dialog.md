# Delete Confirmation Dialog

The delete confirmation dialog triggers before event deletion. You can enable it by setting the `ConfirmDelete` parameter of the Scheduler to `true`. The default texts of the dialog are exposed in the [localization]({%slug globalization-localization%}) messages of the component, and you can customize them.

>important This dialog displays only for **single** events, **not** for recurring. The built-in delete confirmation dialog for recurring events is **not** changed.
