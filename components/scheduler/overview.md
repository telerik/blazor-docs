# Blazor Scheduler Overview

The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/scheduler" target="_blank">Blazor Scheduler component</a> lets users see, edit and add appointments, so they can plan their agenda. The Scheduler offers different views, control over the workday start and end, resource grouping and various other features and settings.


## Creating Blazor Scheduler

1. Use the `<TelerikScheduler>` tag.
1. Set its `Data` parameter to `IEnumerable<TItem>` to define the collection of appointments (events). The Scheduler can [detect and use some property names in the model]({%slug scheduler-appointments-databinding%}#appointment-features), such as `Title`, `Description`, `Start`, `End` and others. Alternatively, you can use different property names and configure them explicitly. See [Data Binding]({%slug scheduler-appointments-databinding%}) for more details.
1. Define the available views that users can toggle. Each view will be a child tag inside `<SchedulerViews>`.
1. (optional) Set `StartTime` and `EndTime` for the views, unless users should see the full 24 hours. Only the time portion of these `DateTime` objects will matter.
1. (optional) Set the Scheduler's `Date` and `View` parameters. By default, users will see today's date and the first view. Both parameters support two-way binding.

## Data Binding

As a data-driven component, the Scheduler needs a collection of appointments to work with. Learn how to [data bind the Scheduler and configure model property names]({%slug scheduler-appointments-databinding%}).


## Views

The [Scheduler offers different views]({%slug scheduler-views-overview%}) that are suitable for different user needs:

* Day view
* Multiday view
* Week view
* Month view
* Timeline (agenda) view


## Editing

Users can [create, edit and delete Scheduler appointments]({%slug scheduler-appointments-edit%}). The component provides you with the new information so you can store it to the underlying data source.


## Navigation

The [Scheduler features extensive navigation]({%slug scheduler-navigation%}), which can be both programmatic and managed by the end user. The component can change the currently visible time range, the current view, and toggle business hours only display.


## Templates

You can [customize the appointment appearance and content via Scheduler templates]({%slug scheduler-templates-appointment%}). Another option is to use the [Scheduler `OnItemRender` event]({%slug scheduler-events%}#itemrender).


## Resources and Grouping

[Scheduler resources]({%slug scheduler-resources%}) provide a way to associate and [group appointments]({%slug scheduler-resource-grouping%}) by certain criteria, such as a meeting room, a participating person, or used equipment.


## Events

The [Scheduler component fires events]({%slug scheduler-events%}) related to CRUD operations, item (appointment) clicks and user navigation. Use them to gain more information about user actions and enhance the component behavior.


## Scheduler Parameters

The following table lists Scheduler parameters, which are not discussed elsewhere in the component documentation. Also check the [Scheduler API Reference](/blazor-ui/api/Telerik.Blazor.Components.TelerikScheduler-1) for a full list of parameters, events and methods.

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)

| Parameter | Type and Default&nbsp;Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Class` | `string` | A custom CSS class for the `<div class="k-scheduler">` element. Use it to [override theme styles]({%slug themes-override%}). |
| `EnableLoaderContainer` | `bool` <br /> (`true`) | Determines if the Scheduler will display a loading animation for operations that take longer than 600 ms. |
| `Height` | `string` | A `height` style in [any supported unit]({%slug common-features/dimensions%}). |
| `Width` | `string` | A `width` style in [any supported unit]({%slug common-features/dimensions%}). |


## Next Steps

* [Bind the Scheduler to data]({%slug scheduler-appointments-databinding%})
* [Configure Scheduler views]({%slug scheduler-views-overview%})
* [Enable Scheduler editing]({%slug scheduler-appointments-edit%})
