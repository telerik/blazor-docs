# Blazor Window Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor Window provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Window is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-window:not(.k-dialog)` | `role=dialog` | Announces the dialog role of the component. |
|  | `aria-labelledby=.k-window-title id` | Associate the title of the dialog. |
| `.k-overlay + .k-window` | `aria-modal=true` | Announces that the dialog is modal. Attribute is added only when the dialog is modal. |


Action buttons follow the **Button** specification.
