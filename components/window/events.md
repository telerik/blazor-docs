# Window Events

This article explains the events available in the Telerik Window for Blazor:


* [VisibleChanged](#visiblechanged)
* [StateChanged](#statechanged)
* [WidthChanged and HeightChanged](#widthchanged-and-heightchanged)
* [Action Click](#action-click)
* [LeftChanged and TopChanged](#leftchanged-and-topchanged)

## VisibleChanged

You can use the `VisibleChanged` event to get notifications when the user tries to close the window. You can effectively cancel the event by *not* propagating the new visibility state to the variable the `Visible` property is bound to. This is the way to cancel the event and keep the window open.

<TelerikButton OnClick="@ToggleWindow">Toggle the Window</TelerikButton>

<TelerikWindow Visible="@isVisible" VisibleChanged="@VisibleChangedHandler">
    <WindowTitle>
        <strong>The Title</strong>
    </WindowTitle>
    <WindowContent>
        This is my window <strong>popup</strong> content.
    </WindowContent>
    <WindowActions>
        <WindowAction Name="Close" />
    </WindowActions>
</TelerikWindow>

@code {
    bool isVisible { get; set; }
    string result { get; set; }

    void VisibleChangedHandler(bool currVisible)
    {
        isVisible = currVisible; // if you don't do this, the window won't close because of the user action

        result = $"the window is now visible: {isVisible}";

        Console.WriteLine("The user closed the window with the [x] button on its toolbar");
    }

    public void ToggleWindow()
    {
        isVisible = !isVisible;

        result = $"the window is now visible: {isVisible}";
    }
}

<TelerikWindow Visible="@isVisible" VisibleChanged="@VisibleChangedHandler">
    <WindowTitle>
        <strong>The Title</strong>
    </WindowTitle>

    bool isClosable { get; set; }

    void VisibleChangedHandler(bool currVisible)
    {
        if (isClosable)
        {
            isVisible = currVisible; // if you don't do this, the window won't close because of the user action
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The user tried to close the window but the code didn't let them");
        }

    }
}

## StateChanged

You can use the `StateChanged` event to get notifications when the user tries to minimize, maximize or restore the window. You can effectively cancel the event by *not* propagating the new state to the variable the `State` property is bound to.

<select @bind=@State>
    <option value=@WindowState.Default>Default</option>
    <option value=@WindowState.Minimized>Minimized</option>
    <option value=@WindowState.Maximized>Maximized</option>
</select>

<TelerikWindow State="@State" StateChanged="@StateChangedHandler" Width="500px" Height="300px" Visible="true"
               Top="500px" Left="600px">

    </WindowTitle>

            <option value=@WindowState.Maximized>Maximized</option>
        </select>
    </WindowContent>
</TelerikWindow>

@code {
    public WindowState State { get; set; } = WindowState.Default;

    string lastUserAction;

    private void StateChangedHandler(WindowState windowState)
    {
        State = windowState; // if you don't do this, the window won't change because of the user action

        lastUserAction = $"last user action was: {windowState}";
    }
}
````

## WidthChanged and HeightChanged

You can use the `WidthChanged` and `HeightChanged` events to get notifications when the user tries to resize the window. The events requires the `Resizable` parameter of the Window to be `true`.

>caption React to the user actions to resizing the window

````CSHTML
<TelerikWindow Visible="true"
               Resizable="true"
               WidthChanged="@WidthChangedHandler"
               HeightChanged="@HeightChangedHandler">
    <WindowTitle>
        <strong>Lorem ipsum</strong>
    </WindowTitle>
    <WindowActions>
        <WindowAction Name="Minimize"></WindowAction>
        <WindowAction Name="Maximize"></WindowAction>
        <WindowAction Name="Close"></WindowAction>
    </WindowActions>
    <WindowContent>
        <strong>Resize Me!</strong>        
    </WindowContent>
</TelerikWindow>

<br />

@EventLog

@code {
    public string EventLog { get; set; }

    public void WidthChangedHandler()
    {
        EventLog = "WidthChanged event fired at: " + DateTime.Now.ToString();
    }

    public void HeightChangedHandler()
    {
        EventLog = "HeightChanged event fired at: " + DateTime.Now.ToString();
    }
}
````

## Action Click

Window actions expose the `OnClick` event. You can use it to implement custom buttons that invoke application logic from the Window's titlebar. See the [Window Actions]({%slug components/window/actions%}) article for examples.

If you use the `OnClick` event on a built-in action, it will act as a custom action and it will no longer perform the built-in feature (for example, close the window). If you want the invoke both a built-in action and custom logic from the same button, you have two options:

* Use the [VisibleChanged](#visiblechanged) and/or the [StateChanged](#statechanged) events to execute the custom logic on the user actions.
* Or, use two-way binding for the corresponding Window parameter (e.g., `@bind-Visible`, or `@bind-State`) and toggle its variable from the custom `OnClick` handler.


## LeftChanged and TopChanged

These two events fire when the user finishes [moving the window]({%slug window-draggable%}). If you set the `Top` and `Left` parameters of the window, you must update their values in these events - either by handling them yourself, or through using two-way binding.

The values will be in pixels, in a `string` format, rounded to one decimal place.

These events will also fire when the user maximizes the window because then its top and left coordinates become `0px`. You can capture this event through the [StateChanged](#statechanged) event that will fire afterwards.

The `LeftChanged` event fires second, so if you intend to store locations in an application state, and you want to do this only once, you can do that in `LeftChanged`.

>caption Handle LeftChanged and TopChanged

````CSHTML
@* If you need to react to the user dragging the window you can handle the events. Otherwise you can simply use two-way binding *@

<TelerikWindow Left="@TheLeft" Top="@TheTop" Draggable="true"
               LeftChanged="@LeftChangedHandler" TopChanged="@TopChangedHandler"
               Visible="true">
    <WindowTitle>Drag me!</WindowTitle>
    <WindowContent>When using Left and Top, make sure to update them in the view-model.</WindowContent>
    <WindowActions>
        <WindowAction Name="Minimize"></WindowAction>
        <WindowAction Name="Maximize"></WindowAction>
    </WindowActions>
</TelerikWindow>

@code{
    string TheLeft { get; set; } = "50px";
    string TheTop { get; set; } = "50px";

    async Task LeftChangedHandler(string currLeft)
    {
        // if you don't do this, the event will be "cancelled" and the position will revert
        TheLeft = currLeft;

        Console.WriteLine("LEFT position changed to: " + TheLeft);

        if(TheLeft == "0px" || TheTop == "0px")
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Maximized. You should use the StateChanged event to capture this");
        }

        // you could store left and top in the application state here if you wish to preserve it for the user
    }

    async Task TopChangedHandler(string currTop)
    {
        // if you don't do this, the event will be "cancelled" and the position will revert
        TheTop = currTop;

        Console.WriteLine("TOP position changed to: " + TheTop);
    }
}
