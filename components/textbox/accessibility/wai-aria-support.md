# Blazor TextBox Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor TextBox provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The TextBox is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


No role attribute is implemented as the `html input type="text"` element is sufficient for defining the purpose of the component.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-input-inner` | `role=textbox` or `nodeName=input` | Describes the role of the component. |
|  | `label for` or `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The input requires an accessible name that will be assigned to it. |
|  | `aria-invalid=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the TextBox is in a form and announces the valid state of the component. |
| `.k-disabled .k-input-inner` | `disabled=disabled` or `aria-disabled=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the TextBox is disabled. |
