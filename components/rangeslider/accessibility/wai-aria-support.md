# Blazor RangeSlider Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor RangeSlider provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The RangeSlider is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

[Slider accessibility specification]({{slider_a11y_link}})


The two focusable elements of the RangeSlider must implement the specification for the **Slider** component. Here is just one clarification for the use of `aria-valuetext` attribute:

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-draghandle` | `aria-valuetext` | Specifies the text that would be announced based on the currently selected values in both handle elements (e.g. `aria-valuetext="10 - 50"`). |
