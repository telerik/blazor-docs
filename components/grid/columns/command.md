# Grid Command Column

The command column of a grid allows you to initiate [inline]({%slug components/grid/editing/inline%}) or [popup]({%slug components/grid/editing/popup%}) editing, or to execute your own commands.

To define it, add a `GridCommandColumn` in the `GridColumns` collection of a grid. The command column takes a collection of `GridCommandButton` instances that invoke the commands. It also offers the `Title` property so you can set its header text.

>tip The lists below showcase the available features and their use. After them you can find a code example that shows declarations and handling.

The `GridCommandButton` tag offers the following features:

* `Command` - the command that will be invoked. Can be one of the built-in commands (see below), or a custom command name.
* `OnClick` - the event handler that the button will fire. If used on a built-in command, this handler will fire before the [corresponding CRUD event]({%slug components/grid/editing/overview%}). Cancelling it will prevent the built-in CRUD event from firing.
* `ShowInEdit` - a boolean property indicating whether the button is only visible while the user is editing/inserting data.
* `ChildContent` - the text the button will render. You can also place it between the command button's opening and closing tags.
* Appearance properties like `Icon`, `Class`, `Enabled` that are come from the underlying [Button Component features]({%slug components/button/overview%}).

There are three built-in commands:

* `Edit` - initiates the inline or popup editing (depending on the GridEditMode configuration of the grid).
* `Save` - performs the actual update operation after the data has been changed. Triggers the `OnUpdate` or `OnCreate` event so you can perform the data source operation. Which event is triggered depends on whether the item was added through the grid or not.
* `Cancel` - aborts the current operation (edit or insert).

The `OnClick` handler of the commands receives an argument of type `GridCommandEventArgs` that exposes the following properties:

* `IsCancelled` - set this to true to prevent the operation if the business logic requires it.
* `Item` - the model item the grid row is bound to. You can use it to access the model fields and methods in order to preform the actual data source operations.
* `IsNew` - a boolean field indicating whether the item was just added through the grid interface.

>tip For handling CRUD operations we recommend that you use the grid events (`OnEdit`, `OnUpdate`, `OnCancel`, `OnCreate`). The `OnClick` handler is available for the built-in commands to provide consistency of the API.

>tip The event handlers use `EventCallback` and can be syncronous or async. This example shows async versions, and the signature for the syncrhronous handlers is `void MyHandlerName(GridCommandEventArgs args)`.

Edit will be cancelled for "name 2". There is a deliberate delay in the event handlers to showcase their async nature. Actual CRUD operations are not implemented, the code showcases how you can obtain the information so you can use it.
