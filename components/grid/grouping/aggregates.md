# Grid Aggregates

The Grid component provides built-in aggregates for column values based on [grouping]({%slug components/grid/features/grouping%}) and also a grand total row.

#### In this article:


* [Available Aggregate Functions](#available-aggregate-functions)
* [Where You Can Use Aggregates](#where-you-can-use-aggregates)
* [How to Enable Aggregates](#how-to-enable-aggregates)
* [Example](#example)
* [Notes](#notes)

## Available Aggregate Functions

There are several available aggregate functions under the `Telerik.Blazor.GridAggregateType` enum:

* `Average`
* `Count`
* `Max`
* `Min`
* `Sum`

The `Count` aggregate can be applied to any type of field. The other aggregates can only be applied to numerical fields (e.g., `int`, `decimal`, `double`, etc.).

## Where You Can Use Aggregates

You can use aggregates in the following templates:

* [`GroupFooterTemplate`]({%slug grid-templates-column-group-footer%}) of a `GridColumn` - a footer in the respective column that renders when the grid is grouped.
* [`GroupHeaderTemplate`]({%slug grid-templates-group-header%}) of a `GridColumn` - a header in the respective column that renders when the grid is grouped by that column. The `Value` field in the context carries the current group value.
* [`FooterTemplate`]({%slug grid-templates-column-footer%}) of a `GridColumn` - a grand total row of footers for the entire grid.

## How to Enable Aggregates

To enable aggregates:

1. Under the `GridAggregates` tag, define the `GridAggregate` entries to enable the aggregations per field you want to use.
1. Use the aggregate result in the templates that support it - their `context` is strongly typed and carries the aggregate values in the respective fields.
1. Set the grid's `Groupable` property to `true`.
    * If you will be using only `FooterTemplate`s - grouping is not required.
1. Group the grid to see the effect on group-specific templates

````CSHTML
Enable and use aggregates. To see the full effect, group by a column - "Team" and then "Active Projects".

## Notes 

* You should define only aggregates that you will use to avoid unnecessary calculations that may be noticeable on large data sets.

* If you try to use an aggregate that is not defined, or an aggregate over an unsupported field type, a runtime error will be thrown.

* If you update a field of a model the `Data` collection in the view-model, aggregates will not be updated automatically - the grid needs to re-evaluate that data first, and since this is an expensive operation a UI render does not trigger it. You can [update the data collection]({%slug grid-refresh-data%}) yourself, or fetching it anew from the service (example [here]({%slug components/grid/editing/overview%}), see how the Create/Update/Delete events fetch data anew).

* If you use [`OnRead`]({%slug components/grid/manual-operations%}), the Grid will calculate aggregates from the data on the current page only. It is still possible to [calculate and display aggregates, which are based on all the data]({%slug grid-templates-column-footer%}#notes).
