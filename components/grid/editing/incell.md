# Grid InCell Editing

In Cell editing allows the user to click cells and type new values immediately like in Excel. There is no need for Edit, Update and Cancel buttons.

Users can use the `Tab`, `Shift+Tab` and `Enter` keys to move between edited cells quickly. If validation is not satisfied, the user cannot exit edit mode, unless they satisfy validation, or cancel changes by pressing `Esc`.

Command columns and non-editable columns are skipped while tabbing.

The InCell edit mode provides a specific user experience and behaves differently than other edit modes. Please review the notes below to get a better understanding of these specifics.

## Basics

To enable InCell editing mode, set the `EditMode` property of the grid to `Telerik.Blazor.GridEditMode.Incell`. You can handle the `OnUpdate`, `OnCreate` and `OnDelete` events to perform the CUD operations, as shown in the example below. 

To add a new item, you must add a [toolbar]({%slug components/grid/features/toolbar%}) with an `Add` command. `OnCreate` will fire immediately when you click the `Add` button - see [Event Sequence](#event-sequence) below.

It is up to the data access logic to save the data once it is changed in the data collection. The example below showcases when that happens and adds some code to provide a visual indication of the change. In a real application, the code for handling data updates may be entirely different.

Click a cell, edit it and click outside of the grid to see the change. You can also use Tab, Shift+Tab and Enter to navigate between the cells.

![Blazor Grid Incell Editing](images/incell-editing.gif)


## Event Sequence

* The `OnCreate` event will fire as soon as you click the `Add` button. The Grid will render the new row and enter edit mode for the first editable column (to fire `OnEdit` and let the user alter the column). This means you should have [default values]({%slug grid-kb-default-value-for-new-row%}) that satisfy any initial validation and requirements your models may have.

    * This means that there is no actual inserted item, an item in InCell editing is always in Edit mode, never in Insert mode. Thus, you cannot use the `InsertedItem` field of the Grid [State]({%slug grid-state%}). If you want to insert items programmatically in the Grid, alter the `Data` collection, and use the `OriginalEditItem` feature of the state (see the [Initiate Editing or Inserting of an Item]({%slug grid-state%}#initiate-editing-or-inserting-of-an-item) example - it can put the InLine and PopUp edit modes in Insert mode, but this cannot work for InCell editing).

* The `OnEdit` event fires every time a cell is opened for editing. Until version **2.27**, the event fired **once per row** - when the user edits a cell from a different row.

* The `OnUpdate` event fires every time an edited cell is closed. Until version **2.27**, the event fired **once per row** - when the currently edited row loses focus.

* If there is a cell that is being edited at the moment, clicking on another cell will first close the current cell and fire `OnUpdate`. To start editing the new cell, you need a second click. When the user removes focus from the Grid or the current row, the `OnUpdate` event fires, where the data-access logic can move it to the actual data source. 

* The `OnCancel` event works only when pressing `Esc`. The `Cancel` command button is not supported. Clicking outside the currently edited cell will trigger `OnUpdate` and thus, clicking on the `Cancel` command button will not fire the `OnCancel` event, because an update has already occured.


## Incell Editing and Selection

* To enable item selection with InCell Edit Mode, add a `<GridCheckboxColumn />` to the `<Columns>` collection. More information on that can be read in the [Selection]({%slug components/grid/selection/overview%}#notes) article.

    * To see how to select the row that is being edited in InCell edit mode without using a `<GridCheckboxColumn />` check out the [Row Selection in Edit with InCell EditMode]({%slug grid-kb-row-select-incell-edit%}) Knowledge Base article.


## Editor Template

The incell editor template requires a focusable element to maintain the tab order when using the keyboard. If you prevent editing based on a runtime condition, you must provide some focusable element. (Setting `Editable=false` for the entire column does not require a focusable element.) Here is one way to add a focusable non-editable element:

    **.razor**

    <EditorTemplate>
        @{
            if (myCurrentEditCondition)
            {
                <MyCustomEditor />
            }
            else
            {
                <div tabindex="0">editing not allowed</div>
            }
        }
    </EditorTemplate>

>tip **All the information below applies up to UI for Blazor 2.29**. Starting from version **2.30**, the Grid captures a generic blur handler inside the editor template to detect when to fire `OnUpdate`. There is no longer a need to listen for a blur event and close the edit cell manually.

When using an [editor template]({%slug components/grid/features/templates%}#edit-template), the grid cannot know what the custom editor needs to do, what it contains, and when it needs to close the cell and update the data, because this is up to the editor. This has the following implications:

* The Grid will still capture `Enter` and `Tab` keypresses when the cell is focused, and will close the cell with the corresponding `OnUpdate` call. You can either use that (e.g., a standard input will let the keypress event propagate to the Grid cell), or you can prevent the event propagation and use only your business logic. If you don't do anything, you will get the default grid behavior for the keyboard navigation even with custom editors.

* The Grid can no longer capture the `onblur` event in a custom editor like it does for built-in editors. It uses it to call `OnUpdate` when the user clicks away from the current row with the mouse. So, when an editor template is open, clicking away will not close it and save the row.

    If you want to get this behavior, you can use the Grid [state]({%slug grid-state%}) to close the cell and you can also invoke the desired operations on the data according to your business logic. For example, a suitable event the Telerik input components provide is `OnBlur`.
    
    **.razor**
    
        <EditorTemplate>
            @{
                CurrentlyEditedLine = context as SampleData;
                <TelerikTextBox OnBlur="@CloseEditorAndSave" 
                    Width="100%" @bind-Value="@CurrentlyEditedLine.LastName">
                </TelerikTextBox>

            }
        </EditorTemplate>


    **C#**
    
        SampleData CurrentlyEditedLine { get; set; }
        TelerikGrid<SampleData> Grid { get; set; }
    
        async Task CloseEditorAndSave()
        {
            var state = Grid?.GetState();
            if (state.EditItem != null)
            {
                // we can reuse the code from the OnUpdate handler
                await UpdateHandler(new GridCommandEventArgs()
                {
                    Item = state.EditItem
                });
                
                // use the state to remove the edited item (close the editor)
                state.EditItem = null;
                state.OriginalEditItem = null;
                await Grid.SetStateAsync(state);
            }
        }
