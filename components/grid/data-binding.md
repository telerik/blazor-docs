# Grid Data Binding

Telerik Blazor Grid is data source agnostic - you can use any database and service according to your project. You only need to get the collection of data models to the Grid in the view-model of the component hosting it.


# Basics

There are two main steps to data bind a Grid:

1. **Provide the data.** There are two ways to do this:
    * Set the Grid **`Data`** parameter. In this case, the Grid will hold **all the data** and will perform all data operations internally (sorting, paging, filtering, grouping, aggregates, etc.). This approach provides **simplicity**.
    * Use the Grid [`OnRead` event]({%slug common-features-data-binding-onread%}) and pass the data to the event argument. In this case, the Grid will hold **only the current page** of data items. The component will fire `OnRead` again for every data operation and expect to receive the expected items. This approach provides **flexibility** and **performance** if the total number of data items is large. Also check the [Grid-specific **`OnRead`** event article]({%slug components/grid/manual-operations%}).
1. **Configure the Grid to display the data.** Again, there are two ways to do this:
    * [Generate some or all columns automatically]({%slug grid-columns-automatically-generated%}). The autogenerated columns will depend on the Model properties and Data Annotations.
    * Define [GridColumn]({%slug components/grid/columns/bound%}) instances and set their `Field` parameter. The field is required for data and CRUD operations. The field type determines the sorting, filtering and editing behavior. Some columns do not need a field, for example the [CommandColumn]({%slug components/grid/columns/command%}). To customize data rendering and column behavior, use [templates]({%slug components/grid/features/templates%}) and all the [column settings](#column-features).


## Data Sources and Scenarios

The following list of resources provides examples for data binding a grid in various scenarios:

* Basic **example**, tutorial **video** and **notes** - [Grid Bound Columns Overview]({%slug components/grid/columns/bound%}). Also lists the features (parameters) of a bound column.

* **Optimizing the data source queries** - see the [Notes]({%slug components/grid/columns/bound%}#notes) section in the article above. In a server-side app, an `IQueryable` that ties to an appropriate context (such as EntityFramework) that can optimize the LINQ queries the grid generates is a quick option. For full control, use the [OnRead event]({%slug components/grid/manual-operations%}).

* **SQL** (or any other) **database** - you can find examples in our [online demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/overview). You can see an offline version of the demos project in the `demos` folder of your installation ([automated]({%slug installation/msi%}) or [archive]({%slug installation/zip%})). They showcase an EntityFramework context using an SQL database that provides data to a grid through a service, which is a common architecture for decouping the front-end from the actual data source that you can apply to any database.

    * The **CRUD sample project** our extensions for [Visual Studio]({%slug getting-started-vs-integration-new-project%}) and [Visual Studio Code]({%slug getting-started-vs-code-integration-overview%}) can generate for you showcases a similar architecture that you can use as a starting point.
    
    * The [Blazing Coffee sample application](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/sample-applications/blazing-coffee) shows how to provide data from a SQL (uses SQLite) database to the Grid using Entity Framework Core services.

* **WebAPI** data source - you can see how to send an appropriate request for data and return an optimized query in the following sample projects: [Grid DataSourceRequest on the server](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/datasourcerequest-on-server). This is a flexible approach that you can use for any type of service you have - serializing and deserializing the data according to the application logic and needs, and optimizing the database queries on the backend.

* **OData** data source - an extension method we provide lets you make OData v4 queries as shown in the following example: [Grid and OData](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/odata).

* **DataTable**, **ExpandoObject** collection - If you don't have actual strongly typed models (yet) and you use `ExpandoObject`, or your backend comes from an older technology and still returns `DataTable`s, the grid can accommodate such dynamic data types. You can get started from our examples on how to bind the grid to a [ExpandoObject collection](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/binding-to-expando-object) and to a [DataTable](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/data-table) which also support [editing]({%slug components/grid/editing/overview%}).

* **gRPC** - the gRPC tooling supports .NET Core, and as of mid-June 2020, there is a package that brings it to WebAssembly. You can find a basic example and more resources to get you started with gRPC in Blazor in the [Grid Data from gRPC Sample Project](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/common/grpc-example).

* **Foreign Keys** - using foreign tables and keys is usually done through the grid templates. You can read more and find examples in the [Grid - Foreign Key]({%slug grids-foreign-key%}) KnowledgeBase article.

## Binding to Interface

Since version 2.27, the Grid supports binding to a collection of multiple model types that implement the same interface.

Note the usage of [`OnModelInit`]({%slug grid-events%}#onmodelinit) in the example below. The event handler sets the model type to be used for new items in the Grid. One-type model creation is supported out-of-the-box. If you need to support adding instances of different types:

* Use custom **Add** buttons in the [Grid Toolbar]({%slug components/grid/features/toolbar%}), one for each model type.
* In each button click handler, define an `InsertedItem` of the correct type in the [Grid State]({%slug grid-state%}).
* [Put the Grid in Insert mode]({%slug grid-state%}#initiate-editing-or-inserting-of-an-item) with the [SetState method]({%slug grid-state%}#methods).

>note Up to version 2.26, the `Data` collection of the Grid must contain instances of only one model type.
