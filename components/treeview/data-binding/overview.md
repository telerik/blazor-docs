# Treeview Data Binding Basics

This article explains the different ways to provide data to a TreeView component, the properties related to data binding and their results.

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/general-info.md#valuebind-vs-databind-link)

First, review:

* The available (bindable) [features of a treeview item](#treeview-item-features).
* How to match fields in the model with the treeview item [data bindings](#data-bindings).

There are three modes of providing data to a treeview, and they all use the items' features. Once you are familiar with the current article, choose the data binding more you wish to use:

* [Flat data]({%slug components/treeview/data-binding/flat-data%}) - a single collection of items with defined parent-child relationships.
* [Hierarchical data]({%slug components/treeview/data-binding/hierarchical-data%}) - separate collections of items and their child items.
* [Load on demand]({%slug components/treeview/data-binding/load-on-demand%}) or lazy loading - providing children to a node when it expands through an event.

## Treeview Item Features

The treeview items provide the following features that you control through the corresponding fields in their data binding:

* `Id` - a unique identifier for the item. Required for binding to flat data.
* `ParentId` - identifies the parent to whom the item belongs. Required only when binding to flat data. All items with the same `ParentId` will be rendered at the same level. For a root level item, this must be `null`.
* `HasChildren` - whether the item has children. Determines whether an expand arrow is rendered next to the item. Required for binding to flat data and for load-on-demand. With hierarchical data, the treeview will render the icon based on the existence of child items, but `HasChildren` will take precedence.
* `Items` - the collection of child items that will be rendered under the current item. Required only when binding to hierarchical data.
* `Text` - the text that will be shown on the item.
* `ImageUrl` / `Icon` / `IconClass` -the URL to a raster image, the [Telerik icon]({%slug general-information/font-icons%}), or a class for a custom font icon that will be rendered in the item. They have the listed order of precedence in case more than one is present in the data (that is, an `ImageUrl` will have the highest importance).
* `Url` - the view the item will navigate to by generating a link.

## Data Bindings

The properties of a treeview item match directly to a field of the model the treeview is bound to. You provide that relationship by providing the name of the field from which the corresponding information is present. To do this, under the `TreeViewBindings` tag, use the `TreeViewBinding` tag properties.

Each `TreeViewBinding` tag exposes the following properties that refer to item properties:

* IdField => Id
* ParentIdField => ParentId
* TextField => Text
* IconClassField => IconClass
* IconField => Icon
* ImageUrlField => ImageUrl
* UrlField => Url
* HasChildrenField => HasChildren
* ItemsField => Items
* Level - this is used for defining [different bindings for different levels](#multiple-level-bindings). If no level is set, the bindings are taken as default for any level that does not have explicit settings. You should have one `TelerikTreeViewBinding` without a level.

>tip There are default values for the field names. If your model names match the defaults, you don't have to define them in the bindings settings.

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/navigation-components.md#default-fields-match-issues)

>important If you are using hierarchical data binding, your model must not contain a field called `ParentId` (or a field that matches the name given to the `ParentIdField` parameter of a `TreeViewBinding`). That would confuse the treeview that it is binding to flat data, and so there may be no roots and you may see no data.

>caption Default field names for treeview item bindings. If you use these, you don't have to specify them in the `TreeViewBinding` tag explicitly.

````CSHTML
public class TreeItem
{
	public int Id { get; set; }
	public string Text { get; set; }
	public int? ParentId { get; set; }
	public bool HasChildren { get; set; }
	public string Icon { get; set; }
	public string Url { get; set; }
}
````

The following **Example** shows how to define simple binding to match item fields to a model so a tree renders the provided flat data source.

### Multiple Level Bindings

You can define different binding settings for the different levels of nodes in a treeview. With this, the children of a node can consume a different field than their parent, and this may make your application more flexible. If you use [hierarchical data binding]({%slug components/treeview/data-binding/hierarchical-data%}), the children can even use a different field or model from their parent.

This also allows you to define a different [`ItemTemplate`]({%slug components/treeview/templates%}) for different levels.

To define multiple bindings, add multiple `TreeViewBinding` tags and define their `Level`.

If a certain level does not have an explicit data bindings tag, it will use the default one that has no level.

````CSHTML
The third level will use the main data bindings settings that do not have a level specified

<TelerikTreeView Data="@FlatData" @bind-ExpandedItems="@ExpandedItems">
	<TreeViewBindings>
		<TreeViewBinding ParentIdField="Parent" />
		<TreeViewBinding Level="1" TextField="SecondText" ParentIdField="Parent" />
	</TreeViewBindings>
</TelerikTreeView>

@code {
	public IEnumerable<TreeItem> FlatData { get; set; }
	public IEnumerable<object> ExpandedItems { get; set; } = new List<TreeItem>();

	public class TreeItem
	{
		public int Id { get; set; }
		public string Text { get; set; }
		public string SecondText { get; set; }
		public int? Parent { get; set; }
		public bool HasChildren { get; set; }
	}

	protected override void OnInitialized()
	{
		LoadFlat();
		ExpandedItems = FlatData.Where(x => x.HasChildren == true).ToList();
	}

	private void LoadFlat()
	{
		List<TreeItem> items = new List<TreeItem>();

		for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++)
		{
			items.Add(new TreeItem()
			{
				Id = i,
				Text = "Parent " + i,
				Parent = null,
				HasChildren = i < 3
			});
		}

		for (int i = 5; i < 15; i++)
		{
			items.Add(new TreeItem()
			{
				Id = i,
				SecondText = "Child " + i, //this is the field used at level 1 - it is a different field than at levels 0 and 2
				Parent = i < 10 ? 1 : 2,
				HasChildren = i == 5
			});
		}

		for (int i = 16; i < 20; i++)
		{
			items.Add(new TreeItem()
			{
				Id = i,
				Text = "Second Child " + i,
				Parent = 5
			});
		}

		FlatData = items;
	}
}

>note For performance reasons, when using [flat data binding](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/treeview/data-binding/flat-data), all the bindings for all the levels must use the same `ParentIdField`.
