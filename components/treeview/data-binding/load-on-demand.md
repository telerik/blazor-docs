# Treeview Load on Demand

This article explains how to load nodes on demand the TreeView for Blazor. 
@[template](/_contentTemplates/treeview/basic-example.md#data-binding-basics-link)


You don't have to provide all the data the treeview will render at once - the root nodes are sufficient for an initial display. You can then use the `OnExpand` event of the treeview to provide [hierarchical data]({%slug components/treeview/data-binding/hierarchical-data%}) to the node that was just expanded. Loading nodes on demand can improve the performance of your application by requesting less data at any given time.

The **example** below shows how you can handle load on demand in detail. It uses two different models for the two different [levels of data bindings]({%slug components/treeview/data-binding/overview%}#multiple-level-bindings) it showcases. You do not have to use different models and/or different bindings.

        // see the information about multiple data bindings earlier in this article on using them

        // check if the item is expanding, we don't need to do anything if it is collapsing
        // in this example we will also check the type of the model to know how to identify the node and what data to load. If you use only one model for all levels, you don't have to do this

        {

                return; // item has been expanded before so it has data, don't load data again
                        // alternatively, load it again but make sure to handle the child items correctly
                        // either overwrite the entire collection, or use some other logic to append/merge
            }
            int itemIdentifier = currCategory.CategoryId;
            // in a similar fashion, you can identify the item that was just expanded through its properties
            // in this example, we will hardcode some data and logic for brevity
            // in a real case, you would probably await a remote endpoint/service

            if (itemIdentifier == 2) // simulate no data for a certain node - the second in our example
