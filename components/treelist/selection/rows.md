# Row Selection

The TreeList component supports [single or multiple row selection]({%slug treelist-selection-overview%}#use-single-or-multiple-selection). You can select a row with mouse click and through a checkbox column. You can access the collection of selected rows, use this collection and modify it. You can subscribe to selection events.

## Basics

By default, users can select rows by clicking anywhere in the row, except on command buttons.

To select a range of rows, hold the **Shift** key, while clicking on the first and last row of the range. To select or deselect multiple rows that don't belong to a range, hold the **Ctrl** key.

Check the [TreeList Keyboard navigation demo](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/treelist/keyboard-navigation) for detailed information about selecting rows with the keyboard.

You can also render a checkbox column that allows users to select and deselect rows. To use checkbox selection, add a [`TreeListCheckboxColumn`]({%slug treelist-columns-checkbox%}) in the `TreeListColumns` collection of the TreeList. The `TreeListCheckboxColumn` provides [additional configuration settings related to selection]({%slug treelist-columns-checkbox%}#parameters).

## SelectedItemsChanged Event

You can respond to user selection actions through the `SelectedItemsChanged` event. The event handler receives a collection of the TreeList data model. The collection may have multiple, single, or no items in it, depending on the `SelectionMode` and the last user selection.

### SelectedItemsChanged and Asynchronous Operations

The `SelectedItemsChanged` event handler cannot be awaited. To execute asynchronous operations when the user selects rows, use the [`OnRowClick`]({%slug treelist-events%}#onrowclick) or [`OnRowDoubleClick`]({%slug treelist-events%}#onrowdoubleclick) event instead.

## Selection When Data Changes

When the TreeList `Data` collection changes, the `SelectedItems` collection has the following behavior:

* When the user updates a selected item and the item instance is replaced, you have to also replace the selected item object in the `SelectedItems` collection. Do that in the [TreeList `OnUpdate` event]({%slug treelist-editing-overview%}#events).
* When the user deletes a selected item, the TreeList automatically deletes it from the `SelectedItems` collection and the [`SelectedItemsChanged` event](#selecteditemschanged) fires.
* To select a new item in the TreeList you can use the [`OnCreate` event]({%slug treelist-editing-overview%}#events) to update the `SelectedItems` collection.

## Equals Comparison

The items in `SelectedItems` are compared against the items in the TreeList data in order to determine which rows will be highlighted. The default framework behavior is to compare objects by reference. The data item references may not match when:

* The `SelectedItems` are obtained from a different data source than the all TreeList items, for example, from a separate service.

In such cases, the selected rows may not appear as expected. You have to [override the `Equals` method of the TreeList model class]({%slug treelist-state%}#basics) so that the items are compared by a unique identifier rather than by reference. When you override `Equals`, it is also recommended to override the [`GetHashCode`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.gethashcode) method.

## Row Selection and Other TreeList Features

The selection behavior may vary when other TreeList features are enabled, such as editing, virtualization, paging, column and row templates, row drag and drop. In such cases you need to consider certain limitations or adjust the application code.

### Selection and Editing Modes

When users edit rows, the row selection has the following behavior:

* In [`Incell` edit mode]({%slug treelist-editing-incell%}) the row selection can work only through a [checkbox column]({%slug treelist-columns-checkbox%}). This is required due to the overlapping pointer events that trigger selection and editing. To see how to select the row that is being edited in `InCell` edit mode without using a `<TreeListCheckboxColumn/>` check out the [Row Selection in Edit with InCell EditMode]({%slug grid-kb-row-select-incell-edit%}) KB article. It is for the Grid component, but the concept is the same.
* [`Inline` edit mode]({%slug treelist-editing-inline%}) and [`Popup` edit mode]({%slug treelist-editing-popup%}) integrate with row selection without limitations.

### Selection and Virtual Scrolling

When the TreeList has [virtual scrolling]({%slug treelist-virtual-scrolling%}), the component is able to select a range of rows with **Shift** only if all rows in that range are currently rendered. Consider the following scenario:

1. Select a row.
1. Scroll down, so that virtualization kicks in and the rendered rows are no longer the same.
1. Select another row with **Shift**.

In this case, the range selection will start from the first row that is currently rendered. Compare with [Selection and paging](#selection-and-paging) below.

### Selection and Paging

The `SelectedItems` collection persists across paging.

### Selection and Templates

When using [TreeList templates]({%slug treelist-templates-overview%}) with row selection:

* If you are using a [TreeList column template]({%slug treelist-templates-column%}) and you have a clickable element in the template, you can check the knowledge base article on [how to prevent row selection when the user clicks another component in the Grid column template]({%slug grid-kb-row-selection-in-column-template%}). It is for the Grid component, but the concept is identical.
* If you are using a [row template]({%slug treelist-templates-row%}) the TreeList cannot render a built-in [checkbox column]({%slug treelist-columns-checkbox%}). You have to render checkboxes manually and handle their changed event to populate the `SelectedItems` collection of the TreeList. You can find an example to get started in the following thread: [Grid Row Template with Selection - Unsure how to Bind to Selected Item](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1463819-grid-row-template-with-selection-unsure-how-to-bind-to-selected-item). It is for the Grid component, but the concept is identical.

### Selection and Row Drag and Drop

The TreeList clears the `SelectedItems` collection when the user drags and drops selected rows.
