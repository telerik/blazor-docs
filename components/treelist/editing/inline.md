# TreeList Inline Editing

Inline TreeList editing lets users modify all values on a TreeList row. The edit process starts and ends with clicking of command buttons on the respective row. Inline editing can be more intuitive for beginner users, compared to in-cell editing.

## Basics

To use inline TreeList editing, [set the TreeList `EditMode` parameter to `TreeListEditMode.Inline`](slug:treelist-editing-overview#edit-modes). During inline editing, only one table row is in edit mode at a time. Users can:

* Press **Tab** or **Shift** + **Tab** to focus the next or previous editable cell.
* Click the **Save** command button or press **Enter** to confirm the current row changes and exit edit mode.
* Click the **Cancel** command button or press **ESC** to cancel the current row changes and exit edit mode.
* Peform another TreeList operation, for example, paging or sorting, to cancel the current edit operation.

## Commands

Inline add, edit, and delete operations use the following [command buttons](slug:treelist-editing-overview#commands):

* **Add**
* **Delete**
* **Edit**
* **Save**
* **Cancel**

@[template](/_contentTemplates/treelist/editing.md#without-commands)

In inline edit mode, the TreeList commands execute row by row and the corresponding [TreeList events](slug:treelist-editing-overview#events) also fire row by row. This is similar to [popup editing](slug:treelist-editing-popup) and unlike [in-cell editing](slug:treelist-editing-incell), where commands and events relate to cells.

When validation is not satisfied, clicking the **Save**, **Delete** or **Add** command buttons has no effect, but users can still navigate between all input components in the row to complete the editing.

## Integration with Other Features

Here is how the component behaves when the user tries to use add and edit operations together with other component features. Also check the [common information on this topic for all edit modes](slug:treelist-editing-overview#integration-with-other-features).

### Add, Edit

This section explains what happens when the component is already in add or edit mode, and the user tries to add or edit another row.

* If the validation is not satisfied, the component blocks the user action until they complete or cancel the current add or edit operation.
* If the validation is satisfied, then editing aborts and the component fires `OnCancel`.

### Delete, Filter, Group, Page, Search, Sort

If the component is already in add or edit mode, and the user tries to perform another data operation, then editing aborts and the component fires `OnCancel`.

## Example

The example below shows how to:

* Implement inline TreeList CRUD operations with the minimal required number of events.
* Bind an editable TreeList to [flat data](slug:treelist-data-binding-flat-data). Check the [popup editing example] for an implementation with [hierarchical data](slug:treelist-data-binding-hierarchical-data).
