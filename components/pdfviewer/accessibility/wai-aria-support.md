# Blazor PDFViewer Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor PDFViewer provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The PDFViewer is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The PDFViewer component contains two inner elements - a toolbar and a page container.

[ToolBar accessibility specification]({{toolbar_a11y_link}})

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-pdfviewer .k-canvas` | `tabindex=0` | Defines the focusable page container element. |
|  | `aria-label` | Describes the purpose of the focusable container. Translatable message. |
|  | `role=document` | Defines that content should be evaluated in reader mode by assistive technologies. |
| `.k-pdfviewer .k-toolbar .k-button:has(.k-svg-i-search, .k-i-search)` | `aria-haspopup=dialog` | Describes that the Search tool button opens a dialog element. |
| `.k-pdfviewer .k-canvas .k-search-panel` | `role=dialog` | Describes the role of the Search panel. |
|  | `aria-label` | Translatable message, same label as the one, used to describe the Toolbar Search tool. |
