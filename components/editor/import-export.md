# Editor Import and Export

The [Telerik Document Processing tools]({%slug common-features-dpl%}) that come with your Blazor license let you import and export the HTML string for the Editor component.

You can easily import from formats such as `docx`, `rtf`, `txt`, `html` and export to them and to `pdf`.

>tip The following sample project shows one way to implement import and export: [Blazor Editor Import and Export](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/editor/ImportExport).

Allowing the application to decide how to import and export the content makes the Telerik UI for Blazor package more lightweight, because it does not always have to carry the document processing dependencies, and it also allows you full flexibility on how you handle and process the content/files.
