# Editor Built-in Tools

explain this is the list of all the available tools and their command reference that you use to call them (e.g., from custom tools). Maybe add a separate section at the end that shows how to invoke a couple from buttons outside the editor, maybe reuse the overview example of insertHtml at cursor. Consider whether this example belongs in a separate article.

tabled list that should contain:
* human readable name
* short description what it does
* class name for adding to toolbar
* event args for invoking custom command
* any other necessary info for invoking commands (if needed)


Consider an HTML table for better portability
