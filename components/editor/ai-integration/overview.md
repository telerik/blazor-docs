# AI Integration Overview

The editor provides AI integration to enhance user productivity and streamline workflows. This integration is available in two ways:

1. **AIPrompt Component**: A reusable component that allows developers to integrate AI-powered prompts into their applications. It provides a structured way to interact with AI models and retrieve intelligent suggestions or completions.

2. **Inline Prompt**: A lightweight, on-the-fly AI prompt feature embedded directly within the editor. This allows users to access AI suggestions seamlessly while editing content without requiring additional setup.


## AI Integration Capabilities

Both features are designed to improve the user experience by leveraging AI capabilities directly within the editor environment.

They provide the following built-in commands:

### Default Commands

* Rewrite
* Fix Mistakes
* Tone (Neutral, Friendly, Casual, Formal)
* Polish formatting
* Adjust Length (Shorter, Longer)
* Translate (English, Spanish, German)
