# AI Integration Overview

The Editor provides AI integration to enhance the user productivity and streamline workflows. This integration is available in two ways:

* **AIPrompt Component**: An [AIPrompt component](slug:aiprompt-overview) that is rendered in a separate pane on the left side of the Editor.

* **Inline Prompt**: A lightweight, on-the-fly AI prompt rendered in a popup that is shown once the user selects text in the Editor.

## AI Integration Capabilities

Both features are designed to improve the user experience by leveraging AI capabilities directly within the Editor environment. The built-in AI integration allows the user to type their prompt and get a response based on the text in the Editor. The users can also use a set of built-in commands:
* Rewrite
* Fix Mistakes
* Tone (Neutral, Friendly, Casual, Formal)
* Polish formatting
* Adjust Length (Shorter, Longer)
* Translate (English, Spanish, German)

These can be customized through the nested configuration options for the [AIPrompt](slug:editor-aiprompt-integration) and [Inline Prompt](slug:editor-inline-prompt-integration).
