# Editor Custom Tool

explain the moving parts (main tag, individual tool tags, name being required, that you can add content inline or in a a component; that the component receives a cascading parameter of the editor so you can invoke commands if your own code is not enough).

Add basic sample of something (maybe the insert at cursor pos), link more samples in blazor-ui (custom ddl, custom dialog, ...)
