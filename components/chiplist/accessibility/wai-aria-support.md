# Blazor ChipList Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor ChipList provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The ChipList is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-chip-list` | `role=listbox` | Announces the list role of the chip list. |
|  | `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | Adds label to the ChipList element. ListBox element requires an accessible name attached to it. |
|  | `aria-orientation=horizontal` | Specifies the horizontal orientation of the chiplist that gives context about the navigation shortcuts. |
|  | `aria-multiselectable=true` | Announces the multiple selection ability of the chiplist. Only when the selection mode is set to multiple. |
| `.k-chip` | `role=option` | Announces the chip is an option inner component of the chip list. |
| `.k-chip.k-selected` | `aria-selected=true` | Announces the chip is selected. |
| `.k-chip:not(.k-selected)` | `aria-selected=false` | Announces the chip is not selected. |
| `.k-chip:has(.k-i-x-circle),.k-chip:has(.k-svg-i-x-circle)` | `aria-keyshortcuts=Enter Delete` | Announces the Delete action along with the default Enter key used for selection/click action. |


When selection is disabled in the ChipList, it should not have its role set to `listbox`. Instead, the attribute should either be omitted, or its value should be set to `none`. In that case the `role` of the Chip elements should remain `button` as per the Chip component specification.
