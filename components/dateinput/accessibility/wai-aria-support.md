# Blazor DateInput Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor DateInput provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The DateInput is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-input-inner` | `role=textbox` or `nodeName=input` | The element should either be an `<input type="text">` element or should have `role="textbox"` assigned. |
|  | `label for` or `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The input needs an accessible name to be assigned to it. |
|  | `readonly=readonly` or `aria-readonly=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the DateInput is readonly. |
|  | `tabindex=0` | The element should be focusable. |
| `.k-disabled .k-input-inner` | `disabled=disabled` or `aria-disabled=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the DateInput is disabled. |
