# FileManager Navigation

The navigation within the file structure of the `FileManager` is achieved with the help of an inbuilt `TreeView` and `Breadcrumb` components.

## TreeView

On the left-hand side of the `FileManager`, there is a nested [Blazor UI TreeView]({%slug treeview-overview%}) component, listing all folders loaded in the `FileManager`. The `TreeView` provides you the possibility to rename files or folders, as well as execute commands with the inbuilt ContextMenu.

## Breadcrumb

On the right side of the `TreeView`, there is a [Blazor UI Breadcrumb]({%slug breadcrumb-overview%}) component that shows the current folder path. The `Breadcrumb` allows you to navigate between the folders in the displayed path.
