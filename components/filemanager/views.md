## FileManager Views

The `FileManager` provides two inbuilt views for content visualization - `Grid` and `List View`.

To switch between the views, use the Toolbar button group.

## Grid View

The Grid view is achieved with the [Blazor Grid]({%slug grid-overview%}) component, and it renders the files in a tabular manner (see [example](#example)).

## List View

The List view is achieved with the help of the [Blazor ListView]({%slug listview-overview%}) component. The content in this view is rendered as a list of thumbnails, representing the files (see [example](#example)).

## Example
