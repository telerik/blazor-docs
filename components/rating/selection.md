# Selection

The Rating allows you to control the selection of its items.

To configure the selection option, use either of the following settings:

* [`Continuous`](#continuous)
* [`Single`](#single)

## Continuous

The continuous selection allows the selection of all items from the start to the end. This is the default selection mode of the Rating.

````CSHTML
<TelerikRating @bind-Value="@Value"
               SelectionMode="RatingSelectionMode.Continuous">
</TelerikRating>

@code {
    private double Value { get; set; } = 1;
}
````

## Single

The single selection allows the selection of a single item. To configure it, set the `SelectionMode` to `Single`.

````CSHTML
<TelerikRating @bind-Value="@Value"
               SelectionMode="RatingSelectionMode.Single">
</TelerikRating>

@code {
    private double Value { get; set; } = 1;
}
````
