# Blazor Wizard Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor Wizard provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Wizard is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2  AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The Wizard component represents a [`tablist`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#tablist) containing [`tabs`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#tab) with related [`tabpanels`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#tabpanel).

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-step-list` | `role=tablist` | Indicates the role of the tablist container element. |
| `.k-step` | `role=none` | The implicit semantics of the `li` element must be removed. |
| `.k-step-link` | `role=tab` | Specifies the role for the step links. |
|  | `aria-controls=.k-wizard-step id` | Refers to the tabpanel element associated with the tab. |
| `.k-step-disabled>.k-step-link` | `aria-disabled=true` | A disabled (inactive) tab. |
| `.k-step-current .k-step-link` | `aria-selected` | Indicates whether the tab control is activated and its associated panel is displayed, or not. |
|  | `aria-current=true` | Indicates whether the tab control is activated and its associated panel is displayed, or not. |
|  | `tabindex=0` | Removes the element from the page Tab sequence. Set when a tab is not selected so that only the selected tab is in the page Tab sequence. |
| `.k-step:not(.k-step-current) .k-step-link` | `tabindex=-1` | Removes the element from the page Tab sequence. Set when a tab is not selected so that only the selected tab is in the page Tab sequence. |
| `.k-wizard-step` | `role=tabpanel` | Specifies the role of the element. |
|  | `aria-label` | Specifies a label tor the panel. As the Wizard represents a step-by-step process, that is usually the pager text (e.g. "Step 2 of 4") |
|  | `tabindex=0` | Keeps the tabpanel in the page tab sequence. |


No aria attributes should be applied to the ProgressBar element as it serves a purely aesthetic purpose.
