# SpeechToTextButton Integration

Integrate the SpeechToTextButton component with forms, input fields, and other UI elements to provide voice input capabilities.

## Binding Recognized Text to an Input Field

Use the `OnResult` event to update an input field with the recognized text. For example, you can enable users to fill out a feedback form by speaking instead of typing. When the user clicks the SpeechToTextButton, the component captures their speech. It then updates the value of a [TelerikTextArea](slug:textarea-overview) with the recognized text.
