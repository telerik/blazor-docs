# Events

This article showcases the available events in the Telerik Slider component:

* [ValueChanged](#valuechanged)
* [OnChange](#onchange)

## ValueChanged

The `ValueChanged` event fires every time the `Value` parameter changes. This happens when the user:
* clicks on the increase/decrease buttons;
* clicks on the track;
* while dragging the handle;

>tip As of version 2.28.0 of Telerik UI for Blazor, the `ValueChanged` event fires continuously while the user is dragging the handle to ensure updating the value accordingly and deliver live UX. Thus, the component will re-render multiple times during the dragging process. If you want to avoid that, you can handle the [`OnChange`](#onchange) event instead.

@*This example showcases one-way data binding by using Value and ValueChanged*@

@TheValue

<TelerikSlider Value="@TheValue" ValueChanged="@( (int v) => ValueChangedHandler(v))"
               SmallStep="5" LargeStep="20" Min="0" Max="100" Width="500px">
</TelerikSlider>

@code{
    int TheValue { get; set; } = 30;

    async Task ValueChangedHandler(int v)
    {
        // update the view-model to let the change render
        // if you avoid that, you wil effectively cancel the event
        TheValue = v;

        Console.WriteLine($"The user has now chosen {v}");
    }
}

## OnChange

The `OnChange` event represents a user action - confirmation of the current value. It fires when the user:
* clicks on the increase/decrease buttons;
* clicks on the track;
* after the user stops dragging the handle;

If you use two-way binding, the [`ValueChanged`](#valuechanged) event will fire continuously while the user is dragging the handle. This will result in continuous component re-rendering. If you want to avoid that, use one-way binding and update the value for the view-model in the `OnChange` event handler.


>tip The `OnChange` event is a custom event and does not interfere with bindings, so you can use it together with models and forms.

    int TheValue { get; set; } = 30;

    async Task OnChangeHandler(object value)
    {
        // update the view-model to let the change render.
        // if you avoid that, you will effectively cancel the event
        TheValue = (int)value;
        result = $"The user selected: {(int)value}";
    }
}
