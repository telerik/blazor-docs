# Blazor Slider Accessibility

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)



Out of the box, the Telerik UI for Blazor Slider provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Slider is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

### Slider Drag Handle

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-draghandle` | `role=slider` | Sets the proper role for Slider. |
|  | `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` or `title` | The Slider needs an accessible name to be assigned to it. |
|  | `aria-valuetext` | Specifies the text that would be announced based on the currently selected value in the Slider. |
|  | `aria-readonly=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the Slider is readonly. |
|  | `aria-invalid=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the Slider is in form and announces the valid state of the component. |
|  | `tabindex=0` | The element must be focusable. |
| `.k-draghandle:not(.k-hsv-draghandle)` | `aria-valuenow` | Specifies the currently selected value in the Slider. |
|  | `aria-valuemin` | Specifies the minimum available value in the Slider. |
|  | `aria-valuemax` | Specifies the maximum available value in the Slider. |
| `.k-slider-vertical .k-draghandle` | `aria-orientation=vertical` | Present only when slider is vertical. |
| `.k-disabled .k-draghandle` | `aria-disabled=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the Slider is disabled. |

> Note that using an `<a>` element for `role="slider"` is not allowed.

### Slider Buttons

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-slider .k-button-decrease, .k-slider .k-button-increase` | `aria-hidden=true` | Hides the decrease/increase button elements and all their children from assistive technologies. |
|  | `tabindex=-1` | Excludes the decorative decrease/increase buttons from the natural tab order of the page. |
