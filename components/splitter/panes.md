# Splitter Panes

The Splitter consists of individual sections called Panes. The Splitter Panes allow you to add any desired content - be that simple text, other components or HTML elements. Declare a `<SplitterPane>` instance inside the `<SplitterPanes>` child tag of the Splitter for each Pane you want to include in the component.

Each Splitter Pane (section) is individually configured and offers the following features:

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/parameters-table-styles.md#table-layout)

| Attribute | Type and Default Value | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `ChildContent` | `RenderFragment` | The standard `RenderFragment` for Blazor that lets you define your content directly between the opening and closing tags of the pane.
| `Class` | `string` | The CSS class that renders on the `<div class="k-pane">` element of the pane. Lets you apply styling such as changing the `overflow` for the content.
| `Collapsed` | `bool` | Whether the pane will be collapsed (not visible). Supports two-way binding.
| `Collapsible` | `bool` | Whether the user can collapse (hide) the pane to provide more room for other panes. When enabled, the adjacent splitbar (the drag handle between the panes) will offer a collapse button for the pane.
| `Max` | `string` | The maximum size the pane can have in pixels or percentages. When it is reached, the user cannot expand its size further.
| `Min` | `string` |  The minimum size the pane can have in pixels or percentages. When it is reached, the user cannot reduce its size further.
| `Resizable` | `bool` <br/> (`true`) | Whether the user can resize the pane by dragging the resize handle (splitbar) between two panes. Resizing means that the adjacent pane will take up the difference in size.
| `Size` | `string`  | The size the pane in pixels or percentages. Must be between `Min` and `Max`. Supports two-way binding.
