# Breadcrumb for Navigation

The Breadcrumb is a different kind of a [menu]({%slug components/menu/overview%}) that is commonly used to navigate between pages in the app - it can generate the needed links for you through its `UrlField` when [data binding]({%slug breadcrumb-data-binding%}).

To use the Breadcrumb for navigating between pages:

* Add the Breadcrumb to the `MainLayot.razor` of your app.
* Put the `@Body` tag in the `<Content>` tag of the drawer.
* Provide a collection of models that describe the pages you want the user to navigate to.

>tip You can find a runnable sample that showcases this in the [Breadcrumb as Navigation]() sample project.
