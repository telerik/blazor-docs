# Breadcrumb for Navigation

The Breadcrumb can be used to navigate between different pages in the application. It can generate the needed links for you through its `UrlField` when [data binding]({%slug breadcrumb-data-binding%}).

In some cases you might prefer to dynamically generate the breadcrumbs based on the current application `Url`. For this scenario you can use the [`NavigationManager`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.navigationmanager) that the component supports and subscribe to its [`LocationChanged`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.navigationmanager.locationchanged) event. Thus, you can set new Breadcrumb items on every location change.

>caption To use the Breadcrumb and dynamically generate its items:

* Add the Breadcrumb to your application.
    * You may want to add it in the `MainLayout.razor` outside of the `@Body`, for example, in the `main` container of your app.

* Inject a `NavigationManager` instance in the file where you want to build the breadcrumbs.

* Handle the `LocationChanged` event of the `NavigationManager`.

* Dynamically generate the Breadcrumb items based on the `Url` provided by the `Location` field of the `LocationChangedEventArgs`.

Here is an example for such a configuration in our public repository - [SubScribeToLocationChanged](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/breadcrumb/subscribe-to-location-changed).
