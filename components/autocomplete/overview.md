# AutoComplete Overview

The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/autocomplete" target="_blank">Blazor AutoComplete component</a> is a textbox that offers the users hints as they type. These suggestions can be [filtered]({%slug autocomplete-filter%}) as the user types. The user can write their own value or click a suggestion from the dropdown to select it and populate the input. You can control the list of suggestions through [data binding]({%slug autocomplete-databind%}), various appearance settings like [dimensions]({%slug common-features/dimensions%}) and [templates]({%slug autocomplete-templates%}).

#### To use a Telerik AutoComplete for Blazor

1. add the `TelerikAutoComplete` tag
1. populate its `Data` property with the collection of items you want in the dropdown
1. (optional) enable features like [filtering]({%slug autocomplete-filter%}) and clear button

    Placeholder="Enter your role (can be free text)" ClearButton="true" />

@code{
    //Current value is null (no item is sellected) which allows the Placeholder to be displayed.
    string TheValue { get; set; }

    List<string> Suggestions { get; set; } = new List<string> {
        "Manager", "Developer", "QA", "Technical Writer", "Support Engineer", "Sales Agent", "Architect", "Designer"
    };
}

>tip If you want to get a value identifier for the items in the dropdown instead of their text, consider the [ComboBox component](../combobox/overview). The **AutoComplete** is a **free text** input that accepts any text the user writes, not just the suggestions from the dropdown. Thus, the `Value` of the AutoComplete is always a `string`, while the ComboBox can provide you with a `number` or a `Guid`, not only a `string`.

>caption Component namespace and reference

The AutoComplete is a generic component and its type is determined by the type of the model you use as its data source. You can find examples in the [Data Bind - Considerations]({%slug autocomplete-databind%}#considerations) article.

## Features

>caption The AutoComplete provides the following features:

* `Class` - the CSS class that will be rendered on the main wrapping element of the AutoComplete.

* `PopupClass` - additional CSS class to customize the appearance of the AutoComplete's dropdown.

* `ClearButton` - whether the user will have the option to clear the selected value with a button on the input. When it is clicked, the `Value` will be updated to `string.Empty`.

* `Data` - allows you to provide the data source. Required.

* `Enabled` - whether the component is enabled.

* `Filterable` - whether [filtering]({%slug autocomplete-filter%}) is enabled for the end user (suggestions will get narrowed down as they type).

* `FilterOperator` - the string operation that will be used for [filtering]({%slug autocomplete-filter%}). Defaults to `StartsWith`.

* `Id` - renders as the `id` attribute on the `<input />` element, so you can attach a `<label for="">` to the input.

* `MinLength` - how many characters the text has to be before the suggestions list appears. Cannot be `0`. Often works together with [filtering]({%slug autocomplete-filter%}).

* `Placeholder` - the text the user sees as a hint when there is no text in the input. In order for it to be shown, the `Value` parameter should be set to the default value for string (`null`).

* `PopupHeight` - the height of the expanded dropdown list element.

* `PopupWidth` - the width of the expanded dropdown list element. If you don't specify a value, the dropdown width will match the main element which can help with responsive layouts and 100% widths.

* `TItem` - the type of the model to which the component is bound. Required if you can't provide `Data` or `Value`. Determines the type of the reference object.

* `Value` and `bind-Value`- get/set the value of the component, can be used for binding. Use the `@bind-Value` syntax for two-way binding, for example, to a variable of your own. The `Value` must be a `string`.

* `ValueField` - the name of the field from the model that will be shown as hints to the user. Defaults to `Value`. Not required when binding to a simple list of strings.

* `Width` - the width of the main element. @[template](/_contentTemplates/inputs/inputs-width-template.md#inputs-width-information)

* `TabIndex` - maps to the `tabindex` attribute of the HTML element. You can use it to customize the order in which the inputs in your form focus with the `Tab` key.

* Templates - they allow you to control the rendering of items in the component. See the [Templates]({%slug autocomplete-templates%}) article for more details.

* Validation - see the [Input Validation]({%slug common-features/input-validation%}) article for more details.
