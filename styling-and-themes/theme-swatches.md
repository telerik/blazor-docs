# Theme Swatches

Each of the [built-in themes]({%slug general-information/themes%}) provides a set of color swatches that you can choose from to match your application appearance and styling. Any of the main themes and their swatches can be easily customized as desired - read more about that in the [Custom Themes article]({%slug themes-custom%}).

You can find the main themes and their swatches in the following resources:

* [Sass Themebuilder](https://themebuilder.telerik.com/blazor-ui) - it is an Angular web application that enables you to [create new or customize existing themes]({%slug themes-custom%}). You can use it to explore how certain theme/swatch will affect the appearance of the Telerik UI for Blazor components.

* [kendo-themes repository](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes) - the repository for all themes and swatches that are used across Telerik and Kendo web components.

* ZIP archive for Telerik UI for Blazor - the `styles` folder contains the base themes and a some of their most commonly used swatches. The [ZIP Archive]({%slug installation/zip%}) article provides more details on how to get the archive.


For ease of access, below you can find a complete list of the base themes, all available swatches and their CDN-s. The swatches are listed under the corresponding main theme they are variations of:

* [Default](#default)
* [Bootstrap](#bootstrap)
* [Material](#material)

>important Make sure that the version in the URLs matches the latest version of the [Kendo Themes](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes).
