# Theme Swatches

Telerik UI for Blazor comes with three [built-in (base) themes]({%slug general-information/themes%}). Each of them provides a set of color swatches that you can choose from to match your application appearance and styling.

#### In this article:
   * [Basics](#basics)
   * [Buit-in themes and swatches list](#buit-in-themes-and-swatches-list)


## Basics

The theme swatches are different color variations of the base themes. While they use the same variables as the built-in theme they accompany, they have different color values to deliver a variety of shades for the Telerik components. Any of the base themes and their swatches can be easily customized as desired - read more about that in the [Custom Themes article]({%slug themes-custom%}).

You can find the built-in themes and their swatches in the following resources:

* [Sass Themebuilder](https://themebuilder.telerik.com/blazor-ui) - it is a web application that enables you to [create new or customize existing themes]({%slug themes-custom%}). You can use it to explore how certain theme/swatch will affect the appearance of the Telerik UI for Blazor components.

* [kendo-themes repository](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes) - the repository for all themes and swatches that are used across Telerik and Kendo web components.

* ZIP archive for Telerik UI for Blazor - the `styles` folder contains the base themes and a some of their most commonly used swatches. The [ZIP Archive]({%slug installation/zip%}) article provides more details on how to get the archive.


## Buit-in themes and swatches list

Here is a complete list of the base themes, all available swatches and their CDN URLs.

* [Default](#default) - These are the mostly ported swatches from our [Sass Themebuilder](https://themebuilder.telerik.com/blazor-ui). Main swatch is the current "Default" theme.

* [Bootstrap](#bootstrap) - Main swatch is the current "[Bootstrap]({%slug general-information/themes%}#bootstrap-notes)" theme, which is built on Bootstrap 5. As the other names suggest, Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 swatches are color swatches adapted to look like the respective versions.

* [Material](#material) - Based on Material Design. Main is our "[Material]({%slug general-information/themes%}#material-notes)" theme, which itself is built around the initial theme of <a href = "https://material.angular.io/" target = "_blank">material.angular.io</a>.

>important Make sure that the theme version in the CDN URL is compatible with the UI for Blazor version. Our [release notes](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/blazor-ui/release-history) provide information about the correct theme version for each UI for Blazor version.
