## Best Way to Customize the Telerik Blazor CSS

There are **three** ways to customize the appearance of the Telerik Blazor components. Each has pros and cons, and each is most suitable for specific scenarios and business requirements. Learn more about the [Blazor CSS theme customization alternatives]({%slug common-kb-theme-customization-options%}).

## Using ThemeBuilder

[ThemeBuilder](https://themebuilderapp.telerik.com) is a web application that enables you to create new themes and customize existing ones.

The tool helps you achieve a unique appearance for your Blazor apps and delivers full control over the visual elements of the Telerik UI for Blazor components. After you create or customize your theme, you can download it and integrate it in your project.


> Starting with R3 2022, ThemeBuilder is accessible from a [new URL](https://themebuilderapp.telerik.com). This new ThemeBuilder version replaces the [previous ThemeBuilder](https://themebuilder.telerik.com/) and provides more free features and also a Pro tier. All your existing custom themes will continue to work in the new ThemeBuilder.

To learn more about using ThemeBuilder, visit the [ThemeBuilder documentation portal](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder) where you can learn how to:

* [Create a custom theme](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder/get-started/first-steps-theme-builder)
* [Import a JSON file with an existing theme](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder/web-app/importing-json)
* [Use the theme in your Blazor app](https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder/exported-package)

## Manual Alternative

Each Kendo UI theme package includes the source files of the respective theme and, thus, provides options for you to modify and rebuild the theme as part of your build process.

For example, you can change the theme colors, remove the CSS of unused components, or use specific theme colors to style your application. The theme source files are located in the scss folder of the theme package.

For the full list of variables that can be modified in a theme, refer to the [Using Variables](#using-variables) section.

To build a custom theme by using the theme variables, apply either of the following approaches:

* [(Recommended) Use the build process of your application](#using-the-build-process-of-the-application)&mdash;This approach simplifies the upgrades to new theme package versions.
* [Use the build process of the themes](#using-the-build-process-of-the-themes)&mdash;This approach requires you to build the theme each time the theme packages are updated.

### Using the Build Process of the Application

When you want to built the Telerik themes yourself (for example, to combine them with the rest of your styles in to one stylesheet), review the following article first, before continuing with the steps below: [https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes/wiki/Compiling-themes](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes/wiki/Compiling-themes).

To customize a Sass-based theme, create a `.scss` file and consume the theme package in the following way:

1. Obtain the theme source through the NPM package.

        npm install @progress/kendo-theme-default

1. Create a `.scss` file that will consume the theme. For the purposes of the example, this is `styles.scss`.

1. To build the theme files, import them into the `styles.scss` file.

        @import "node_modules/@progress/kendo-theme-default/dist/all.scss";

   The `dist/all` file adds the styles for all components that are available in the theme. To trim down the size of the generated CSS, import only the source for the components that you use in your application. Each of them could be found in `scss/` folder.

        // Import only the Grid and TreeView styles using Node Sass
        @import "~@progress/kendo-theme-default/scss/grid/_index.scss";
        @import "~@progress/kendo-theme-default/scss/treeview/_index.scss";

        // or using Dart Sass
        @import "~@progress/kendo-theme-default/scss/grid/";
        @import "~@progress/kendo-theme-default/scss/treeview/";

1. To customize the variables that are used in the theme, change the theme before you import the theme files.

        $primary: #E82C0C; // brand color

        @import "~@progress/kendo-theme-default/dist/all.scss";

1. Build the `styles.scss` file through a Sass compiler.

    To use Node Sass (which uses [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass)), install the compiler with `npm install node-sass --save` and then compile the file with the following command

        node-sass styles.scss styles.css

    To use [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass), install the compiler with `npm install node-sass@npm:sass --save` and then compile the file with the following command

        sass styles.scss styles.css


### Using the Build Process of the Themes

While each Sass-based theme has a dedicated NPM package (for example, @progress/kendo-theme-default), the source code for all themes is located in the [kendo-themes](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes) repository which contains a build task that compiles the theme sources to CSS. To customize a theme, modify the source code of the theme and use the build task to produce a CSS file for your application. This approach avoids the need for a setting up a build configuration when you compile SCSS, but may be harder to maintain as the process has to be repeated each time we update a theme.

You have two options to do that (described in turn below):

* Customizing Themes with Swatches
* Customizing the Source Code
* Creating Custom Components Bundle

#### Customizing Themes with Swatches

A swatch is a set of variables which customizes the appearance of the theme.

* Each swatch is placed in a separate file. A theme may contain multiple swatches.
* Swatches are useful for creating multiple, persistent theme variations.
* The `.css` output file can be shared across projects and requires no further processing.

To create a swatch:

1. Clone the [kendo-themes](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes) GitHub repository.
1. Install the [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) package.
1. Install the dependencies for all themes with `npm install && npx lerna bootstrap`.
1. Switch the working directory to `packages/<THEME_NAME>`.
1. Create a `SWATCH_NAME.scss` swatch file in the `scss/swatches` folder.
1. To build the swatches for the theme by running `npm run sass:swatches` or `npm run dart:swatches`.
1. Include the compiled CSS swatch file in your project. It could be found under `dist/SWATCH_NAME.css`.

For example, in the Material theme create `blue-pink-dark` swatch with the following lines:

    // Variables.
    $primary-palette-name: blue;
    $secondary-palette-name: pink;
    $theme-type: dark;

    // Import the theme file for the components you use.
    @import "../panelbar/_index.scss";
    @import "../grid/_index.scss";

    // Alternatively, include all components.
    @import "../all.scss";


For the Default and Bootstrap themes, the swatch should look like:

    // Variables.
    $primary: blue;
    $secondary: pink;

    // Import the theme file for the components you use.
    @import "../panelbar/_index.scss";
    @import "../grid/_index.scss";

    // Alternatively, include all components.
    @import "../all.scss";

#### Customizing the Source Code

To create a custom theme by modifying the themes source code:

1. Clone the [kendo-themes](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes) GitHub repository.
1. Install the dependencies for all themes with `npm install && npx lerna bootstrap`.
1. Customize the theme variables in the `packages/THEME_NAME/scss/_variables.scss` files.
1. Build the themes with the `npm run sass` or `npm run dart` command to create the customized version of the themes in the `packages/THEME_NAME/dist/all.css` file.
1. After the build completes, reference the compiled CSS in your application.

#### Creating Custom Components Bundle

You might want to omit the styles for some components in the CSS output. To include only the styles that you need:

1. Clone the [kendo-themes](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes) GitHub repository.
1. Install the dependencies for all themes with `npm install && npx lerna bootstrap`.
1. Switch the working directory to `packages/<THEME_NAME>`.
1. Create a `CUSTOM_THEME.scss` file in the `scss` folder. For example, create `custom.scss` file with the following lines:

    ```scss
    // Import the theme file for the components you use.
    @import "../panelbar/_index.scss";
    @import "../grid/_index.scss";
    ```

1. To build the file, navigate to the theme folder and run `gulp sass --file "scss/CUSTOM_THEME.scss"`.
1. Include the compiled CSS file in your project. It could be found under `dist/CUSTOM_THEME.css`.


### Using Variables

The following list describes the theme variables available for adjustment in the Kendo UI Default theme.

@[template](/_contentTemplates/common/theme-variables.md#variables-usage)


## How to Use a Custom Theme I Have

You have your custom theme - either generated through the Telerik ThemeBuilder tool, or one that you built yourself, or something that your organization provides.

To use that, instead of one of the built-in themes, you need to:

1. Add the customized `.css` file to your application, usually in the `wwwroot` folder. For example, it can be in a folder called `myCustomTelerikThemes` and the file itself could be called `SomeCustomTheme.css`.

1. Include the custom stylesheet file in the `head` tag of your index document (by default `wwwroot/index.html` for WebAssembly apps and `~/Pages/_Host.cshtml` for server-side Blazor apps). This could looks something like this:

    **Index file**
    
        <head>
            <!-- More content can be present here -->
             
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="myCustomTelerikThemes/SomeCustomTheme.css" />
            
            <!-- More content can be present here -->
        </head>

1. Make sure that this is the only Telerik Theme that is referenced in the application. If you are using a built-in theme, you must remove its `<link>` element.
