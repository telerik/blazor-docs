# Themes Overview

Telerik UI for Blazor comes with a set of built-in CSS themes that control the visual appearance of the components. Each theme determines the components' colors, borders, backgrounds, size, layout, position, font size and sometimes the font family.

## Basics

### Theme

A *theme* is a collection of styles in a CSS file, which determine the appearance of the Telerik Blazor components, including fonts, colors, sizes and layouts. For example, *Default* and *Bootstrap* are two [built-in theme names](#built-in-themes).

### Swatch

A *theme swatch* is a color variation of a theme. All <a href="https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/themes/kendo-themes/default/swatches/" target="_blank">swatches of a given theme></a> use the same fonts, sizes, and layouts. On the other hand, the text colors, background colors and border colors are different. For example, *Default Ocean Blue* and *Bootstrap Nordic* are two built-in swatch names.

When the Telerik UI for Blazor documentation talks about a given theme name, for example *Default*, this implies the *Main* swatch of this theme. In addition, the word "theme" as a general term can imply any swatch of any theme.

The CSS file of any swatch is self-sufficient and contains all required styles for the Telerik Blazor components, except the optional [font icon styles]({%slug common-features-icons%}#font-icon-stylesheet). You can [switch the theme runtime]({%slug common-kb-change-theme-runtime%}), but the Blazor app should always load only one theme at a time.

### Integration with the Telerik Components

The CSS themes represent an external dependency to Telerik UI for Blazor:

* The themes represent a separate product, which is used by multiple Telerik and Kendo UI products. [Each Telerik UI for Blazor version is compatible with specific theme versions](#compatibility-and-maintenance).
* The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/themes/get-started/introduction/" target="_blank">Telerik and Kendo UI Themes documentation</a> is part of the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/" target="_blank">Telerik Design System documentation</a>. The content in the Telerik UI for Blazor documentation is introductory or specific only to the Blazor components.
* The Telerik and Kendo UI Themes have their own product development, roadmap and strategy. You can log public feature requests or bug reports on the [Telerik Themes feedback portal](https://feedback.telerik.com/themes).


## Built-in Themes

The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/themes/get-started/introduction/#available-themes" target="_blank">Themes - Get Started page</a> lists the built-in themes in Telerik UI for Blazor and describes their unique specifics.

### Comparing Themes and Swatches

You can explore and compare the built-in theme swatches on the [live Telerik UI for Blazor demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/overview). Use the **Change Theme** dropdown above each component example. To test how the available swatches affect the appearance of the Telerik UI for Blazor components, you can also check the [ThemeBuilder app](https://themebuilderapp.telerik.com). This tool provides the ability to <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/themebuilder/introduction" target="_blank">customize the existing themes and swatches</a>.


## Using a Theme

To register a theme, you must reference its stylesheet in the `<head>` of the web page. The exact project file that contains the `<head>` tag depends on the .NET version and the Blazor application type. See our [Getting Started guides]({%slug blazor-overview%}#getting-started) for more information.

There are three ways to load a Telerik theme, in terms of physical CSS file location. Note that each option provides access to a different number of theme swatches.

* [Load a CSS theme as a static asset from the `Telerik.UI.for.Blazor` NuGet package](#loading-themes-from-the-nuget-package). This is the easiest option and it doesn't require maintenance during [Telerik UI for Blazor version upgrades]({%slug upgrade-tutorial%}). However, you can use only the *Main* swatch of each theme and the *Ocean Blue* swatch of the *Default* theme.
* Load a CSS theme from a remote URL, for example, CDN. The dedicated <a href="https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/themes/kendo-themes/default/" target="_blank">documentation of each theme provides a list of swatches and their URLs</a>.
* Load a CSS theme as a local file in the `wwwroot` folder in the Blazor app. This option is relevant to the following cases:
    * When using [custom themes]({%slug themes-customize%}).
    * When [creating]({%slug getting-started-vs-integration-new-project%}) or [converting]({%slug getting-started-vs-integration-convert-project%}) Telerik Blazor apps with the [Telerik UI for Blazor Visual Studio extension]({%slug getting-started-vs-integration-overview%}).
    * When using themes from the Telerik UI for Blazor [MSI installer]({%slug installation/msi%}) or [ZIP archive]({%slug installation/zip%}). The CSS files are in the `swatches` folder.
    * When using [LibMan]({%slug common-kb-telerik-themes-libman%}) or <a href="https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/themes/get-started/installation/" target="_blank">npm</a> to obtain a specific Telerik theme version. In this case, you can use all built-in theme swatches.

> The Blazor app must load only one Telerik theme file at a time. Upgrade the theme with every Telerik UI for Blazor version upgrade, unless you are loading the theme as a static NuGet asset.

### Loading Themes from the NuGet Package

The easiest way to load a Telerik theme in a Blazor app is to reference a static asset from the NuGet package. The .NET SDK will copy the CSS file to the output folder during build automatically. Static assets provide the following benefits:

* The application relies on available local resources, instead of third parties and remote URLs.
* The theme URL does not change across component versions, which makes product updates easier. [Add a cache buster to avoid possible browser caching issues]({%slug common-kb-browser-cache-buster%}).

The `Telerik.UI.for.Blazor` NuGet package includes only the *Main* swatch of each theme and the *Ocean Blue* swatch of the *Default* theme. The code snippet below shows all available CSS files in the NuGet package and their correct URLs. To use another swatch, see the section [Using a Theme](#using-a-theme) above.

>caption Load a Telerik theme as a static NuGet asset

<div class="skip-repl"></div>

````HTML
<head>
    <!-- Choose only one theme. -->
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="_content/Telerik.UI.for.Blazor/css/kendo-theme-default/all.css" />

    <!--

    <link href="_content/Telerik.UI.for.Blazor/css/kendo-theme-fluent/all.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    -->
</head>
````

> Trial users must add `.Trial` to the theme URL:
>
> `<link rel="stylesheet" href="_content/Telerik.UI.for.Blazor.Trial/css/kendo-theme-default/all.css" />`

## Compatibility and Maintenance

The Telerik themes are decoupled from the Telerik Blazor components, which leads to the following usage requirements:

* When using a CSS theme as local file in `wwwroot`, [replace the file every time you change the Telerik UI for Blazor version]({%slug upgrade-tutorial%}). This includes apps [created with the Telerik Blazor Visual Studio extension without CDN support]({%slug getting-started-vs-integration-new-project%}#step-3-configure-additional-project-settings).
* When loading <a href="https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/themes/kendo-themes/default/swatches/" target="_blank">theme swatches</a> from a CDN, make sure that the theme version is compatible with the Telerik UI for Blazor version. Our [release notes](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/blazor-ui/release-history) provide theme compatibility information for each components version. You can also use a <a href="https://www.telerik.com/design-system/docs/themes/get-started/changelog/" target="_blank">newer minor theme version</a>, which doesn't contain breaking changes. In other words, the latest major theme version may be still incompatible with the latest version of Telerik UI for Blazor.
