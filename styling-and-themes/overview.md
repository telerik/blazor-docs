# Built-in Themes

Telerik UI for Blazor comes with a set of built-in themes that you can choose from to alter the visual appearance of our components. You can compare all themes on the [Telerik UI for Blazor live demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/)).

The available built-in themes are:

* **Default** is our own neutral styling that suits most cases. The theme has a [swatch (color variation)]({%slug themes-swatches%}) called [Ocean Blue]({%slug themes-accessibility-swatch%}), which features enhanced accessibility.
* **Bootstrap** matches the styling of the [Bootstrap CSS framework](https://getbootstrap.com). Read more in the [Bootstrap Notes](#bootstrap-notes) section below.
* **Material** implements the [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/design/). Read more in the [Material Notes](#material-notes) section below.
* **Fluent** is based on [Microsoft Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui/).

Telerik UI for Blazor has the same HTML rendering and SASS theme stylesheets as the Kendo UI widgets, so previous experience with them can be helpful. The components in **UI for Blazor are native components** and not wrappers over jQuery widgets.

## Using a Theme

To register a theme, you must reference its stylesheet in the `<head>` the web page. The exact file that contains the `<head>` tag depends on the .NET version and the Blazor application type. See our [Getting Started guides]({%slug blazor-overview%}#getting-started) for more information.

The easiest option is to use a theme as a static asset from the NuGet package. The .NET SDK will copy the CSS file to the output folder during build automatically. Static assets provide the following benefits:

* The application relies on available local resources and not on third parties and remote URLs.
* The theme URL does not change across component versions, which makes product updates easier.

>caption Load a Telerik theme as a static asset

````HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Choose only one theme -->
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="_content/Telerik.UI.for.Blazor/css/kendo-theme-default/all.css" />

    <!--

      -->

An alternative option is to load a theme from the [Telerik CDN]({%slug common-features-cdn%}). The URLs for the theme swatches are listed in the [Theme Swatches]({%slug themes-swatches%}) article.


## Optional Dependency Management

Instead of a CDN or our static assets, you can fetch the stylesheet into your project to, for example, customize the theme, or to bundle it with other stylesheets. To do this, you can:

* [Use LibMan client-side dependency manager](#libman).
* [Use the NPM packages](#npm-packages).

### Libman
The [LibMan client-side dependency manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/libman/?view=aspnetcore-2.2) is built-in ASP.NET Core:

1. In the server application root, add the `libman.json` file with the following content:

    **libman.json**

        {
          "version": "1.0",
          "defaultProvider": "unpkg",
          "libraries": [
            {
              "library": "@progress/kendo-theme-default@latest",
              "destination": "wwwroot/css/kendo-themes/default",
              "files": [
                "dist/all.css"
              ]
            },
            {
              "library": "@progress/kendo-theme-bootstrap@latest",
              "destination": "wwwroot/css/kendo-themes/bootstrap",
              "files": [
                "dist/all.css"
              ]
            },
            {
              "library": "@progress/kendo-theme-material@latest",
              "destination": "wwwroot/css/kendo-themes/material",
              "files": [
                "dist/all.css"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        
        
    > Using the `@latest` theme version requires using the latest Telerik UI for Blazor version as well.
    >
    > There have been some reports that the `@latest` version sometimes leads to an error similar to `The "@progress/kendo-theme-material@latest" library could not be resolved by the "unpkg" provider`. In such cases, you can replace the `@latest` moniker with a [specific theme version](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes/releases). For example, use `^8.0.0` to get the latest version of the major release `8`.
    
    >tip You may want to add a package reference to the `Microsoft.Web.LibraryManager.Build` package so that dependencies are resolved at build-time by LibMan, instead of manually. If a version has already been restored, you may need to invoke a `Rebuild` to update it.

1. In the client Blazor application, go to the `wwwroot/index.html` file and replace the CDN link with the following one. For a server-side Blazor project, do that in the `~/Pages/_Host.cshtml` file.

    **Index file with local stylesheet**
    
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            . . .
            <link href="/css/kendo-themes/default/dist/all.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
            <!-- Choose only one of the themes -->
            <!-- <link href="/css/kendo-themes/bootstrap/dist/all.css" rel="stylesheet" />
            <link href="/css/kendo-themes/material/dist/all.css" rel="stylesheet" /> -->
        </head>
        
            . . .
            
        </html>

### NPM Packages

The Kendo UI Sass-based themes are located on the Progress NPM registry:

* **Kendo UI Default Theme**&mdash;Available as @progress/kendo-theme-default.
* **Kendo UI Bootstrap v4 Theme**&mdash;Available as @progress/kendo-theme-bootstrap.
* **Kendo UI Material Theme**&mdash;Available as @progress/kendo-theme-material.

You can read more about using this approach at [Building Custom Themes]({%slug themes-custom%}#building-themes-from-source-code).


## Material Notes

For the Telerik Material theme to closely implement the <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/" target="_blank">Material Design Guidelines</a>, you should provide the `Roboto` font family.

By default, the Material theme uses the Roboto font family but the font itself is not included in the Telerik theme - it is not our property and it will also add bloat to our package.

You can add the font to the page from Google Fonts in the following way:

<div class="skip-repl"></div>

````HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700" />

<style>
  body { font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; }
</style>
````

## Bootstrap Notes

The Telerik Bootstrap Theme has a design that is similar to the Bootstrap framework style so you can better integrate the Telerik components in an app that already uses Bootstrap for layouts and styles.

Bootstrap and Telerik UI for Blazor are two completely separate products that do not share classes or code. The Telerik Bootstrap theme is not the same as the Bootstrap framework (or styles). Our theme only uses the same Bootstrap metrics and design approaches to fit into a Bootstrap layout better.

You can use Bootstrap to create layouts and then put our components inside those layouts. You can use Bootstrap classes and utilities on your own elements in the markup regardless of the components inside. Using Bootstrap classes on our components may lead to styling conflicts and is generally not necessary or recommended.

### Bootstrap Framework Alternatives

If you do not want to use the Bootstrap framework to create your layouts, there are several components from the Telerik UI for Blazor suite that can serve similar purposes. Below you will find some examples to get you started:

* The [Splitter](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/splitter/overview) is useful for organizing the whole page in areas, for example - header, left content, right content, footer. Splitter panes can be collapsed and resized.

* The [GridLayout](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/gridlayout/overview) displays items in rows and columns, similar to the CSS grid layout.

* The [StackLayout](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/stacklayout/overview) displays cards in a single row or column with some spacing options.

* The [TileLayout](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/tilelayout/overview) displays tiles that are resizable and reorderable.

* The [MediaQuery](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/mediaquery/overview) can help you reach to viewport size changes and render different layout depending on the screen size (even replace entire rendering and components, not just hide elements with CSS).

* The [Form](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/form/overview) can generate inputs and editors for your model without the need to spell every input out yourself.

* Popups such as [tooltips](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/tooltip/overview), [windows](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/window/overview), [notifications](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/notification/overview) and [confirmation dialogs](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/dialog/predefined-dialogs) let you conserve real estate on the screen.

* [Cards](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/card/overview) let you add quick and easy distinction and styling between items in sets of information.

* Many other components help with navigation and layouts, review the [list of available components in our demos](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui).
