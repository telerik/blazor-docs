# Rendering Changes in 3.4.0

## "k-state" CSS classes

Previous to the 3.4.0 version we used `k-state-*` CSS classes to denote that the state of an HTML element happened. As part of the 3.4.0 release, we remove the `state` segment of that classes.

>caption A list of all changed "k-state" classes

| Pre-3.4.0        | 3.4.0      |
|------------------|------------|
| k-state-focus    | k-focus    |
| k-state-focused  | k-focused  |
| k-state-hover    | k-hover    |
| k-state-hovered  | k-hovered  |
| k-state-selected | k-selected |
| k-state-disabled | k-disabled |
| k-state-invalid  | k-invalid  |
| k-state-active   | k-active   |


## Dialog

* Added `k-dialog-wrapper` CSS class to the outermost HTML element, which holds the modal overlay and the dialog instance.
* Removed the `k-centered` CSS class from the `<div class="k-window k-dialog">`.
