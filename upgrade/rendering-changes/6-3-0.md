## AIPrompt

1. The view buttons in the toolbar are now fully rounded (`k-rounded-md` class is replaced with `k-rounded-full`). The same applies to the `Generate` button.
2. The output view, which contains the `k-card-list` element, is now wrapped in a `div` element with the class `k-prompt-view`.
3. The copy button in the output view is now styled as primary.

## Gantt

1. The `k-gantt-content` class is now applied to a wrapper `div` element that encloses the Gantt Splitter.
2. The Splitter component class (`k-splitter` element) is now changed from `k-grid-content` to `k-grid-splitter`.
3. The `k-gantt-tables` element no longer includes the `k-user-select-none` class.
4. The `k-gantt-rows` element now also has a `k-grid-table` class.
5. The `k-spacer` element in the toolbar no longer has the `k-toolbar-spacer` class.
6. The `k-gantt-views` button group / select element is now wrapped in a `div` with the `k-gantt-views-wrapper` class.

## Menu

1. The menu item elements (`k-link`) no longer include the `k-in` class.
2. The `k-menu-group` elements no longer include the `k-reset` and `k-group` classes.

## PDFViewer

The `Open`, `Download` and `Print` tools have been moved to a submenu toggled on click of a hamburger menu on the leftmost side of the Toolbar.

## Signature

1. The `k-signature-action k-signature-minimize` element no longer includes the `k-rotate-180` class.
2. When maximized, the Signature now renders the `k-signature-maximized` class.
3. The fill mode class is now applied based on the `FillMode` parameter (appearance settings).

## TabStrip

1. The active (currently selected) tabs now render only the `k-active` class. The` k-tab-on-top` class is no longer applied.
2. The inactive tabs no longer include the `k-state-default` class.
3. The scroll buttons (prev & next) now render the `k-tabstrip-prev` and `k-tabstrip-next` classes, respectively.
4. The `k-pos-relative` class is no longer applied to the `k-tabstrip` element. The component now receives an inline `position: relative` style instead.

## TreeList

1. The `k-cursor-pointer` class is removed from the `k-treelist-toggle` element (toggle row icon).
2. The `k-table` element rendered in the `k-grid-header > k-grid-header-wrap` element now also has the `k-grid-header-table` class.
3. The `k-grid-content > k-table element` now also includes a size class (appearance settings).
4. The `k-filterable` class in the table header cells is now rendered only when the column is filterable and has either a filter menu or column menu.
