# Rendering Changes in 10.0.0

## AIPrompt

The AIPrompt component now renders suggestion items using a new markup structure:

* The `k-prompt-suggestion` element is replaced by `k-suggestion`.
* The `k-suggestion-group` element wraps all `k-suggestion` elements.

## Chat

The `div.k-message-list` element no longer renders a `k-avatars` CSS class.
