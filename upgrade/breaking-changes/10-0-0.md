# Breaking Changes in 10.0.0

## AIPrompt

The `OnOutputRate` event and the `ShowOutputRating` parameter are removed in version 10.0.0. To implement output rating or similar actions, use an output action and handle it through the [`OnOutputActionClick` event](slug:aiprompt-events#onoutputactionclick).

The **Retry** and **Copy** actions remain built-in, but you now need to define them as part of the `OutputActions` collection. For details on how to use output actions and handle user interaction, see the [OutputActionClick event example](slug:aiprompt-events#onoutputactionclick), which demonstrates how to configure the `OutputActions` collection, including the built-in **Copy** and **Retry** actions.
