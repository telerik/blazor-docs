# Upcoming Breaking Changes in 3.0.0

> This article is a heads up for the upcoming changes in Telerik UI for Blazor 3.0.0 release, which will be shipped in mid January 2022. While typically such articles are published at the day of a release, we wanted to make sure we inform our customers in advance and provide time to plan and prepare for what's coming. Additionally with the 3.0.0 release we will update the current article with "how to" guidelines, so that are enabled with everything you need for a smooth upgrade.

## Component Changes

- TileLayout - Introduce identifier of the TileLayout item. `OnResize` and `OnReorder` events will receive EventArgs that will point to the resized/reordered item. This feature comes from our [public issue tracker](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1489011)
- TreeView - add `ExpandedItems` parameter and remove `ExpandedField`
- Grid – change `OnRead` method to return the `Data`. This is an important change that will empower us to deliver more features in the future(like the export of all Grid pages), and the Grid will not rely on component lifecycle for getting the data.
- Grid – use `IFilterDescriptor` in GridState instead of `FilterDescriptorBase`
- DateInput – remove `ParsingErrorMessage` in favor of localization string for the error message
- ContextMenu – add `EventArgs` to the `OnClick` event
- All input elements – remove hardcoded width style in our Blazor components. In addition, the default style that comes from the themes will be updated to change the width to 100%.


Grid EditorTemplates and Keyboard Navigation are in design stage. So, there might be changes coming from this direction as well.

## Common Changes

- [`IconName` class]({%slug common-kb-migration-from-iconname%}) (already obsolete) class will be removed. All icon names should be retrieved from the [built-in icons documentation]({%slug general-information/font-icons%}#icons-list).
- `ToODataString` extension method is moved to the `Telerik.Blazor.Extensions` namespace.

## Parameter Naming

We are unifying our API with some parameter naming.

- `UpdateInterval` Parameter of Editor is changed to `DebounceDelay`
- `Content` RenderFragment Parameter of the Drawer is changed to `DrawerContent`
- `IsCanceled` Parameter in `StepperStepChangeEventArgs` is renamed to `IsCancelled`
- `IsSeparatorField` is removed in favor of `SeparatorField`

## Rendering & Themes

- `k-widget` class is removed from the components
- `width:100%` is the new default width of all input-based components instead of `12.5em`
-  Html classes and DOM element hierarchy will be updated for Buttons, Inputs, Selects, DatePickers Checkbox, Switch. 
- `k-state-focused` is renamed to `k-focus`
