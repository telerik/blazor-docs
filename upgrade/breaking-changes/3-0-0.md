# Upcoming Breaking Changes in 3.0.0

> The 3.0.0 release will be shipped in mid January. The following list of breaking changes will be updated with detailed explanation how to migrate your project.

## Component Changes

- TileLayout - Introduce identifier of the TileLayout item. OnResize and OnReorder events will receive EventArgs that will point to the item that has been resized/reordered. This items comes from our [user voice](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1489011)
- TreeView - add `ExpandedItems` parameter to remove `ExpandedField`
- Grid – change `OnRead` method to return the `Data`
- Grid – use `IFilterDescriptor` in GridState instead of `FilterDescriptorBase`
- DateInput – remove `ParsingErrorMessage` in favor of localization string for the error message
- ContextMenu – add EventArgs to the OnClick event
- All input elements – remove hardcoded width style in our Blazor components. In addition, the default style that comes from the themes will be updated to change the width to 100%.
