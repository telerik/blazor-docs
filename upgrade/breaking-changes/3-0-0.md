# Upcoming Breaking Changes in 3.0.0

> This article is a heads up for the upcoming changes in Telerik UI for Blazor 3.0.0 release, which will be shipped in mid January 2022. While typically such articles are published at the day of a release, we wanted to make sure we inform our customers in advance and provide time to plan and prepare for what's coming. Additionally with the 3.0.0 release we will update the current article with "how to" guidelines, so that are enabled with everything you need for a smooth upgrade.

## Component Changes

- TileLayout - Introduce identifier of the TileLayout item. `OnResize` and `OnReorder` events will receive EventArgs that will point to the resized/reordered item. This feature comes from our [public issue tracker](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1489011)
- TreeView - add `ExpandedItems` parameter and remove `ExpandedField`
- Grid – change `OnRead` method to return the `Data`. This is an important change that will empower us to deliver more features in the future(like the export of all Grid pages), and the Grid will not rely on component lifecycle for getting the data.
- Grid – use `IFilterDescriptor` in GridState instead of `FilterDescriptorBase`
- DateInput – remove `ParsingErrorMessage` in favor of localization string for the error message
- ContextMenu – add `EventArgs` to the `OnClick` event
- Dropdown components – remove default inline style of `width: 300px`. The new default width is `100%` and comes from the theme CSS. Applies to AutoComplete, ComboBox, DropDownList, MultiSelect.
- Textbox components - change default theme width from `12.4em` to `100%`. Applies to DateInput, Date/Time Picker, MaskedTextBox, NumericTextBox, TextArea, TextBox.

Grid EditorTemplates and Keyboard Navigation are in design stage. So, there might be changes coming from this direction as well.

## Common Changes

- [`Telerik.Blazor.IconName` class]({%slug common-kb-migration-from-iconname%}) ([obsolete since version 2.0]({%slug changes-in-2-0-0%})) is removed. Use the icon names from the [Built-in Icons documentation]({%slug general-information/font-icons%}#icons-list).
- [`ToODataString` extension method](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/api/Telerik.Blazor.Extensions.DataSourceExtensions) is moved to the [`Telerik.Blazor.Extensions` namespace](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/api/Telerik.Blazor.Extensions). The `Telerik.Blazor.ExtensionMethods` namespace is removed in favor of `Telerik.Blazor.Extensions`.

## Parameter Naming

We are making our API naming more consistent.

- `UpdateInterval` Parameter of Editor is changed to `DebounceDelay`
- Drawer `Content` RenderFragment is renamed to `DrawerContent`
- Stepper - `IsCanceled` property in `StepperStepChangeEventArgs` (obsolete since 2.26) is removed in favor of `IsCancelled`
- Drawer `IsSeparatorField` is removed in favor of [`SeparatorField`]({%slug drawer-data-binding%})

## Rendering and Themes

- `k-widget` CSS class is removed from all components. If you have used this class in custom CSS code, replace it with the corresponding component-specific classes (`.k-grid`, `.k-combobox`, `.k-datepicker`, etc.)
- `width: 100%` is the new default theme style of all textbox components instead of `width: 12.4em`
-  HTML classes and DOM element hierarchy will be updated for Buttons, Inputs, Selects, DatePickers Checkbox, Switch.
- `k-state-focused` is renamed to `k-focus`
