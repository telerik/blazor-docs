# Breaking Changes in 8.0.0

This article outlines the breaking changes in Telerik UI for Blazor version 8.0.0.

## License Key

Telerik UI for Blazor requires a license key for both new and existing applications. For details, see the licensing documentation:

* [Install License Key in Local Development Environment](slug:installation-license-key)
* [Install License Key in CI/CD Environment](slug:deployment-license-key)
* [Troubleshoot License Key Errors](slug:troubleshooting-license-key-errors)

## NuGet Packages

Telerik UI for Blazor 8.0.0 [depends on a new `Telerik.Licensing` NuGet package](slug:getting-started/what-you-need#nuget-packages). This change may be relevant to environments that:

* Rely on local NuGet feeds, Azure Artifacts, or other configurations that do not use real-time NuGet package downloading.
* Use [Telerik NuGet package source mapping](slug:installation/nuget#package-source-mapping), because `Telerik.Licensing` is hosted on `nuget.org`.
